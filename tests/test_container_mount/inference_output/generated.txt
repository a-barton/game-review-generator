Portal 2 draws from the award-winning formula of innovative gameplay, story, and music that earned the original Portal over 70 industry accolades and created a cult following.
The single-player portion of Portal 2 introduces a cast of dynamic new characters, a host of fresh puzzle elements, and a much larger set of devious test chambers. Players will explore never-before-seen areas of the Aperture Science Labs and be reunited with GLaDOS, the occasionally murderous computer companion who guided them through the original game.
The game’s two-player cooperative mode features its own entirely separate campaign with a unique story, test chambers, and two new player characters. This new mode forces players to reconsider everything they thought they knew about portals. Success will require them to not just act cooperatively, but to think cooperatively.
Review: Portal 2 is one of the best puzzle games made by Valve, an amazing piece of software designed for people’s amusement.

A New Frontier of the Aperture Science Labs

When Portal 2 was announced back in 2013, the developer took a new approach. In a major twist, the game introduced some weird and innovative gameplay mechanics from its beginning. But it has been around long enough to show that it can play its kind of puzzle game.
And the result could very well be what was imagined by an audience. The game’s single-player section features lots of new characters and puzzles from previous games, and introduces a much larger set of devious test chambers. If you want to explore all the tests, you can find the new players only within the new areas of the labs. So do these new players.

A New Frontier of the Aperture Science Labs

The game developed by Portal 2 is now part of Valve’s new adventure franchise. The company’s new open world style is similar to their earlier RPG, which would be the second of their two games.
But the new feature-set in Portal 3 takes a long time to develop, and we have lots of new people that want to play through it so you can get a really good review and a great experience.
The new feature-sets start with the standard “class” of Portal 3, the new classes of the first feature-set added: game engine, world simulation, multiplayer modes, etc. And then the portal mechanics come from other games and then turn on another feature-set.
