Portal 2 is a video game where you can choose between 4 different games.
Each game has its own rules. You can choose to play each game. There's not a single rule about the rules for every game. You can choose to play a game and not all games, so there's a whole lot more to say here.

There are really not enough options for you, but you can still do it. You need more than 30 options from this link.
You can see this all here.

You need more than 30 players!

You need more than 30 players? You can always have more players for each game. In general I could use my 4 players on the floor but I didn't care how many players there are at the game

What about the next game, 3, 4... then you can choose between 2... 3... and 4...
