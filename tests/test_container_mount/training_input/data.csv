review
"Here's a game that knows how to deliver an emotional gut punch, or twenty. Its core mechanic is the injuries that the heroine can suffer without dying, and use them to get through the levels. Get your hand chopped off, and throw it to knock a crate down. Set yourself on fire to burn something. Get your neck broken to have a change of perspective. Then fix yourself and keep going. And the story is... Well, it's very much about personal trauma. Without going too deep into the spoilers territory, I'll just say that the mechanics are used to tell a story in a way so clever that it all clicks together in the end, when you realise what it all was about.
For those who value games that have something to say, and that, instead of trying to be books or movies, say it with the games' unique element -- interactivity -- this game is a must play."
"There are many games out there that even though don't appeal to me, I can understand the praise.

This one totally isn't like those.

To begin with, the full experience depends entirely on a single buton.
That's it. The same button to attack, to block and to use your special attack - infact pressing a button to attack isn't even necessary as your character does it automatically.
Somehow that design idea made into the final thing and never got changed even with lots of feedback about it on the forums.
You'll find yourself just mindlessly walking towards enemies, casually blocking and hoping for the best because a slight positioning failure means you can be hit through your block very often  (at least I like to tell myself that's the reason I got hit, because it makes no sense visually)

Then there are the items, which tremendously lack impact. You can barely feel any difference when equipping something new. What's the point of +3 str when huge enemies die in two hits? What does spirit even mean?

On the exploration point, it couldn't even be generic and bland. It had to be just bad.
You get to the desert and then there are endless rooms connected to each other at some part, for no reason.
Dungeons have you entering through the left just to appear at the botton of the next, and this happens furiously often.
Since there's nothing to find, rooms are the same, there's very little freedom to transverse through areas and they're just a corridor with a few enemies, luckly a key or a door, the level design is exclusively bad.

There's also no story, no purpose, nothing to put the setting into perspective. This is fine by itself if the gameplay could stand on its own legs but it clearly cannot.

I've tried giving lots of chances to this game, perhaps because of the art, but time after time I quit bored out of my mind just forcing myself to get to the end of a dungeon."
Sea Chicken!
"Escape rooms are pretty much the one genre that I don't think I'll ever get tired of, especially in VR, but I have to admit that a lot of the releases in the recent tides of escape room VR games have been kind of mediocre (which to be fair is pretty much the same as real-life escape rooms, which in my experience vary dramatically in quality). Abode is not one of those games. Pretty much everything about it is well-designed and high quality, there's lots of things to interact and play with, and it even has a little detective fedora that you can put on your virtual head while you solve its puzzles. The thing that's hard to explain but easy for anyone who's played a VR game to understand is how important that sort of thing is. When you can pick up a lit cigar that has nothing to do with any of the puzzles and pull an unlit cigar from a case and touch the ends together to light the unlit one, it's an insignificant action, but it does a lot to give you a sense of presence in the game, and Abode does that sort of thing really well. It's on the longer end of the spectrum as far as length goes, so you can get at least a little under an hour out of it. It's hard to say much without talking too much about the game, but if you like escape room games you'll love Abode. Escape!VR has been my favorite escape game ever since it came out, and it's still great, but Abode just took that seat."
"At first, I thought this was a janky bad mess. Looks bad, bugs out sometimes, limited floor and colour palettes, and sometimes completely non-sensical maps. 

Upon playing with a team of somewhat serious-minded folks familiar with the SCP universe, everything about this game got so much better - especially if everyone gets into their role. Telling everyone to hush over the radio, because you've just heard something odd. The desparate panic that occurs when an SCP shows up. Being the last survivor in your NTF squad, and praying for back-up. The joy of actually making it to the surface as D-Class. 

This game is a prime example of ""asymmetrical gameplay"": 

- SCPs rule everything they see around them, and can only be brought down through co-ordination. 
- The NTF and the Chaos Insurgery are middle-ground, and are easily overwhelmed by SCPs / co-ordinated D-Classers
- The D-Class personnel are nothing more than cannon fodder at first. You have to sneak around, or use diplomacy to stay alive. Finding a weapon really doesn't improve your chances, but hell, at least you feel safe now. 
- The Scientists are the wild card feature. You can either work with the D-Class folks, or you can try and survive on your own. The NTF teams may be coming to help you, but honestly, they probably won't find you before they get butchered by something else. 

Keep an eye on this game, and play it with large groups over Discord. This is a game with extraordinary potential."
A bit hard to start off with but once you get the hang of it is a pretty top notch racing sim
"The game is awesome good fun for everyone, even those who'd consider themselves FPS challenged. Can't aim? No problem, we'll give you a whole day to line up your shot. Dodge a bullet... easy peazy when you're in control of time itself. Heck when you master the hotness you won't have to, you'll just blow minds away.

And the graphics are superstylistically indie masterpieces of motion. Turns out all you need to make the next great jump in the genre is red, white and black and to have time and motion inexorably linked."
"3D Platformer from the mid-2000s running out of the box on modern systems with controller support and Steam Features?

For free?

Where is the catch?"
"TLDR: 9/10, 100% worth playing if you love classic style RPGs 

Radiant Arc is a fantastic RPGMaker game. You control Linky in his quest to help prevent global disaster. Along the way, you discover future party members, develop new abilities, find new and powerful gear, and ultimately how to save the world.

Pros:
 - Choose which enemies you fight. No random battles - enemies are sprites on the screen you can either avoid or fight head on (attacking from behind for an advantage). 
 - Fantastic character progression. The gear, skill system, and leveling system feel immensely rewarding and useful. Probably my favorite part of this game.
 - Battle system gives you plenty of options and play styles. DOZENS of different useful abilities on every character and each character with a different specialty. Pure physical attacker, SUPER useful tank, physical attacker with great elemental support, healing, mage, ninja, etc. 
 - Side areas (and some side quests). From the start, an entire continent opens up to you. A good dozen of side ""caves"" are open from the very start with recommended levels displayed over the top. Each side area contains special and more powerful gear to find. There are a bunch of these continents for you to eventually explore. You can cheese your way through (trying to avoid the enemies, steal the chests) to gain a more powerful advantage for other areas your actually supposed to be at. I found this extremely entertaining and oddly satisfying. Jumping into an area 10+ levels above me to get some sick gear was fun - especially dying numerous times from the enemies I couldn't *quite* dodge in time.
 - Level and map designs are great.
 - Pretty substantial game length. May play time was a bit inflated because of leaving the game open while away but I'd estimate a good 20-30 hours to get through everything.
 - Very responsive dev

Neutral
 - Plot and writing are fairly standard. Characters were unique but not a TON of depth in developing them
 - Minor errors, such as the occasional spelling mistake, which are being ironed out

Cons
 - Descriptions of some skills are a bit vague. Certain skills that increase base stats appear not to do anything (only the high level skills) but after a battle refresh the stat screen reflects these changes. Took me a LONG time to figure this out.

Overall
 - This game is currently $5.99. It is EASILY worth more than double this. I'd highly recommend it to anyone who loves a good classic RPG, even with RPGMaker assets. Don't hesitate to pick up this game."
"[u]I played this on the Oculus Rift with Touch Controllers and there were no issues [/u].  This is another VR escape room.  It is pretty well made, but it does have a few issues.  

Positives:

+ logical, straightforward puzzles
+ nice atmosphere
+ 10-20 minutes of gameplay
+ free

Negatives
- graphics are subpar
- candle seems to provide no light outside of its intended area
- pointing at a door to open it is pretty unimmersive, would prefer locomotion options and using hands to open
- no real story or a bizzare one to think about [spoiler] the story is you're  a pizza delivery guy who was knocked out after delivery and now you have to escape or die trying and apparently the guys who left you chained up are long gone now so don't worry about them now [/spoiler]
- bugs (how to get yourself out of chains is too specific, random crashes, on last room I escaped simply by pointing which I think was a bug)

Overall, I do recommend for download if you like Escape Room /Puzzle type VR games.  I had fun despite the problems.

Rating 6/10"

Salary Man Escape is a physics-based puzzle game.

In each level you’re presented with a miniature scene which contains a small salary man, and a door. You don’t control the salary man, but if there’s a clear path toward the exit then he’ll automatically walk towards it.

What you can do is manipulate the red blocks and platforms to rearrange the scene. Things start off pretty simple, as you would expect, and the later levels become real head scratchers.

The coffee cups act as checkpoints, so if you get stuck you can try again without restarting from the very beginning of the level.

The art style is pretty cool. It’s a mostly monochromatic world which allows the red blocks to stand out and be easily seen.

There’s 78 levels, with an estimated 8 hours of gameplay. So there’s a lot of content in here. And VR isn’t required, you can play this in regular flatscreen as well.

I found this pretty fun. If you’re a puzzle fan then I definitely recommend it."
"I'm gonna keep it short and sweet:

This game is an underrated gem.

Oxenfree is the love child of ""Life is Strange"" and ""Stranger Things"" (the Netflix series). It's a mix of time travel and 2 realities colliding (with one being much darker and gruesome than the other). So if you are interested in any of that and actual choice based elements, this is your cup of tea/coffee/hot chocolate or if you dont fancy that crap, your can of beer/pop. Sod off if you like plain water, fizzy water still welcome.

Jokes aside this is one of the games that I recommended to my friends the most, it has superb writing, gorgeous visuals, beautiful music and voice acting and an interesting storyline with choices that more or less make big differences.
It also has replayability as there is a newgame+ option (which also adds some new choices and voice lines to the story) and there are multiple endings that you can get (albeit in the same concept with different meanings).

The voice acting is a huge thing in this game, you can hear emotions and valunrabilities in the character voices, as if it's really happening.

Controls are great but there are a few places here and there that may frustrate you a little bit. (and this is probably my only minus points for this game)

I feel sad that so many people ended up skipping this game because the screenshots and trailers don't really represent the depth that this game has. Believe me, it's worth your time and it is value for money.

In any case, if you do grab it, I hope you enjoy it :)"
"This is seriously the best party game. I love that you can actually play with 8 people. Plus it's really easy to pick up- even people who don't play video games at all can learn fast. And with all the different levels, you can easily play for hours without getting bored. Highly recommend!
"
"This is an actual good game, I promise its not because the 9ft woman with a fat ass"
For what this game is I say its very cute And relaxing to me ^^ It Starts off Kai MC Chara Lost his Memory and Woke up On Lake And Mystery Girl Grabbed him and took him into her house. In fact Many of the House Hold people Lost All there Memories And in order to Slowly gain them back they have to Live in the Paradise House. Nobody can get hurt Outside they have all they need Food shelter Games Family etc Nice Peaceful Place But Someone Warns Kai NOT to go outside into the Forest Once you go in Theres NO Coming back. Day in and Day out countless People Come inside the House Do sue Losing there Memory also so they decide to live in Paradise Where Nothing can go wrong. Wellll For what Its Worth I Liked it And People Def should get it Its nice Soothing music Charas And very nice Colors If you Like Light Hearted VN Games Then Def get this one.
"I'm a big fan of The Talos Principle, and since this is a direct VR adaptation of that game the reviews for the gameplay in the flat version speak for themselves.  I will say if you're going in blind, TP a Portal-esque maze puzzler. You go around giant worlds solving puzzles as a sentient lab rat, but Talos Principle has a much more philosophical bent. You're the subject of a kind of Turing Test, and are never quite sure if what you see and hear is true, or if it's part of the test. Especially interesting are the interactions with Milton on the library terminals, who may be a simple library program, a complicated AI, or a researcher messing with your mind. The more I played, the more I realized I was solving puzzles just to get access to more terminals to continue the conversation. I found it to be an extremely well written, emotionally evolving story with a beautifully designed, fun to play puzzle game thrown in as a bonus.

The puzzles are fun without being punishing, and though you can die from sentry turrets and roaming mines, there are very few gotcha moments, and checkpoints are never very far behind. There is a small bit of jumping puzzle action toward the end (which I'm not a fan of) along with some timed events but those are few and far between. For the majority of the game, Talos is a very peaceful, relaxing game experience. The beautiful open air environments and soundtrack give the game a very zen garden feel.

From the VR side of things, the developers did as good of a job converting Talos Principle to VR as Serious Sam. The best thing I can say is that you'd never know it wasn't made for VR. It has 100%  motion control and roomscale support. It also supports seated and standing if you don't feel like walking around, and full gamepad support if that's your thing.

And locomotion? Play as you like with ""classic"" FPS style movement on the trackpad or teleport, and steer with headlook or controller aim. Adjust your walking/running speed, teleport speed, with comfort options to curtail motion sickness. Plenty of options to control the game how you like.

The virtual worlds are lovely and have a real sense of place, and the 3D audio is good enough to let you know where enemies and obstacles are just by listening. Again, TP feels like it was made for VR.

If you like puzzles, philosophical sci-fi and are hungry for an AAA quality VR game with substance and playtime beyond a few hours, Talos Principle will make you very happy."
I remeber playing this on my ps2 when i was a little boy. The good times i had on the original Thril ville but i always wanted off the rails but never got the chance to have it so i found it on steam. Bought it. Then connected my PS3 Controler and played it like it was a PS2. Aww the memories.
"A chilling glimpse into the upcoming eight-part Abbot's Book. I loved the eerie atmosphere and attention to detail. Although the demo is very short, I spent longer just admiring the environment as I explored the dark ruins by the light of a torch. Spooky, with a brooding gothic tone. I can't wait to see more!

"
"I am not one for long words - this game makes you feel stupid and then minutes later feel like a genius.

The presentation will not for everyone. I liked the 1bit style look and I loved the music.

Lucas Pope did it again, after Paper's Please and now Return of the Obra Dinn I will buy anything this guy will have a hand on."
Good ending to this short but fun read. Sad is finished and it left me looking for something with a similar vibe. Really enjoyed all the characters and the setting of the game. Hope they make an appearance in the next Qureate like Cattleya did. Need Vol. 4 Plumeria days
I've been playing for a solid 4 hours now and I still love it! Thank you for making a truly FUN VR experiance.

“Eighteen years ago, Guinevere was on the brink of destruction. Aided by his army, one powerful man nearly conquered the city for himself …”   
 
Guinevere has been attacked; King Leorus III has been killed by The Warlord who seeks to rule Guinevere and its people. However, there are still some who oppose The Warlord and his cruel murdering army and will do anything to protect Guinevere. Uriel, Lowangen, Kei and Vhalidir make a final stand against The Warlord, finally defeating him. He accepts that he’s lost this fight, but states that he will return.  For now, though, Guinevere is safe. 

It’s now the present day, eighteen years later, and the people of Guinevere have lived in peace and prosperity since The Warlord was defeated. It’s here that your story begins.  You play as Lane (you can change name of the characters if you wish) who has been having these weird dreams lately. Lane is hoping that tonight something more will happen in his dream so that he can try and understand what it means.  Light and Darkness now begins, after a short introduction you’re woken up by Amber, a friend of yours, as you had just dropped to the floor asleep in class. You need to join the rest of the class down in the courtyard, so you head off to join the rest of the class. Lane explains to Amber about his weird dream on the way to the courtyard. 

As you make your way to the courtyard, you can interact with other students and characters who may give you some information on the history of Guinevere, Guinevere's Academy of Magic, and its people. When interacting with some characters you may have options to choose from, such as encouraging them or staying quiet. You can also find more information in the Academy’s library which will help you learn about things such as Allies, Elements, The Eldyrians, Professions. Check the Glossary for information, which can be found in the menu. 

Unlike some games of this genre, battles are not random; you can see your enemy. Moving to them and selecting the A button (on gamepad) will take you into battle mode with the enemy. Your characters will be on the right-hand side of the screen with the enemy on the left. Your characters are divided into two rows; the back row is ideal for those who are of more use in a support role, while the front row is for those who use more physical attacks. Each character in your group will take turns in any actions you give them to proceed with. Once you have defeated the enemy, you may be rewarded with Experience Points, Gold and Dropped Items. 

As you make your way through the game, you’ll uncover new areas and dungeons. To move through these areas, you may have to solve puzzles to progress. There are some places which don’t have any effect on the story, but they may have some lovely unique loot should you be able to progress in those areas. These areas consist of tougher encounters compared to other areas, so it’s up to you whether you take on the challenge and see what lies beyond. Loot is usually found in chests, but you can also find things scattered around rooms on tables etcetera.  

New characters will join and leave your group of characters as you progress through the game. They all have their own abilities; some can use magic while others are more melee fighters at the frontline of battle. All characters will need to work together as they battle enemies.  

In the game’s settings you’ll find All, General, Audio, Visual and Controls. All is where you’ll find all the settings under one category. In General, there’s options for Always Dash and Command Remember On/Off. Audio shows settings for Master, Background Music, Background Sounds, Music Effects and Sound Effects. In Visual you’ll find Window Tone Red, Green and Blue which will allow you to customise the colour tone of the games window. In Controls there’s Gamepad and Keyboard Configs where you can configure your gamepad or keyboard keys to your own preference. You can also Reset to Default should you wish to go back to the standard configuration. Starting a new game, you’ll have the choice of four game difficulties: Storyteller, Student, Journeyman and Wind Adept. 

I am a sucker for these types of games, especially when they’re well-made, as Trials of Guinevere is. The graphics and sounds are very good, the story is excellent, and there’s plenty of interaction with the characters of Guinevere. There’s also plenty of information about the region of Guinevere. The battles are easy to learn, and they aren’t too hard or overly complicated. Overall, I’m loving the game so far and would certainly recommend it, especially if you like these types of games. THUMBS UP!!! 

Positives 
+ Good graphics, music and sounds 
+ Excellent storyline 
+ Enjoyable to play 

Negatives 
- No cards currently 

It’s eighteen years after The Warlord attacked Guinevere and the death of King Leorus III. Lead Lane and other students from the Guinevere's Academy of Magic against The Warlord as he returns to claim Guinevere as his own.

"My early review: Legion War for the price is a nice clean wonderful 4X game that plays like the new influx of board game apps you are starting to see. It is the start of Bear and Cat Studios and their intro is just great in its simplicity and duplexity at the same time.  For now, 4 starting factions ships unlocking part of the part to win the war. That simple. As leader of the new Turn-Base Genre group, let's take a peak at what Legion does right and what needs to improve.
PROS
Aesthetics: Let me get this straight, wonderfully layout, simple, beautiful, colorful and the characters are all well done and thought out.  Simple enough, a plus.
Presentation: Is clean, some nice visuals, easy functions, plays like an app and suddenly realized it plays like a board game than some extravagant pressure game were the stakes are nerve racking. Good 
Theme: Easy for even children to play with, with no real traumatizing storylines or graphic violence or bloodshed. Fun for all ages to try. Have at Thee! Then your good here. 
Sequence: You get the hang of it quickly. Easy controls. It took a start or two, but not that annoying if you discover mistakes and plenty of fun abilities ships can do that make the game fun to play. Sounds, Effects, Visuals, and theme are all positives in the game.
Classic: Like Stratego, Chess, Chinese Checkers, Checkers, and other classic board games. There is a clean purpose from start to finish that can involve you for hours. See con.
Theme: Can easily see it released on other formats and a nice template to build on. Additions to the game will only improve the base play with options down the road for this new developer to explore. More factions expanded factions of the factions already there.
CONS
Story: The simplicity of the game is also its weakness because it has no storyline that matters to the gamer. It does teach good fun strategy, but no real purpose that makes you want to play it over and over for now. This is Might and Magic, Duelist, Hearthstone Effects, Phantom. They take bits of other games and just add them, that does not mean they are necessary or needed.
Capped: Games like this need to stop capping themselves with minion types and tier building. For example, why use an Archer late game. Like Might and Magic, by the end, you're recruiting only the most powerful units. That is redundant and boring. The progression system of a small unit should progress a customized upgraded mutation within the unit, not archer to archer w items, but archer, to ranger, to hunter to etc. Then expand from that in size by job type, not strength by type. A mistake all developers continue to make. Thus, bringing nothing new to the genre.
Fluff: Another game like M&M that make it about the race to power, not rewarded for the fruits of your labors. Why cap at population. If your going to simplify and do Civilization, then don’t repeat the same mistakes with 1 v 1 capped chess warfare.  
Old Hat: There are some balancing and spawning issues the AI does to try and balance things.  There are also functions that are not clearly defined. Fortification, AI spawns for no reason, boxed researched trees that games copy, but no real invention of the chess format. You can play Card game war with a deck of cards and still be the last one wins, but what are you doing different. 
EARLY ACCESS review-Means just that, things can change, they will adapt and add. 
My Thoughts of Legion War. A board game, App, console, and other formats, but they must work on a not capping itself with old turn base chess themes. Might and Magic, Civs. Final Theory, Duelist, have all done this, what can we do better, not the same. This game could have appeared in any genre and still worked. It’s a fun board game to me. It is not innovative or creating anything new but dresses it up in a fun manner. It also caps itself with the number of areas unnecessarily. Wonderful start for B&C studios first induction is comparable to any board game in a store and gives you a lot for the price as a start. The game can be addicting, but in the end, will not hold up in replay-ability in redundant themes in the long run. I can see it as a wonderful multi player game if they alter the tier class idea to progression within the class instead of chess class level. Everyone will just purchase Queens.  A borderline positive review for me for its one-time release, but great additions could make this game a classic. See the video section above discussion to see if it’s for you. Wait for a sale. A nice introduction my score 2.9 out of 5"
"If only Steam had been around when this game was fresh, I could have tracked the endless hours I poured into it. There aren't many first person shooters out there that could beat what this had to offer at the time. Expansive maps, excellent sniping, and a huge and dedicated community. If dfbarracks, df radio, or dfgirls ring a bell to you, you'll know what I'm talking about."
"If you enjoy more than 2 of these games, you'll most likely enjoy this:

Slay the Spire
Monster Train
GWENT
SteamWorld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech
FTL
Griftlands
Darkest Dungeon 
Hearthstone
"
"very quality game, hold speed run record and 100 percent completion. mom came in and beat me. Cant wait for wet girl 2, this game made me the man who I am today."
"I have never had so much fun dying over and over, this is beyond worth it's asking price."
"Awesome game! But it has to develop a little bit more, as it fails to keep me coming back.

PROS:
- Very nice system of movement and weapon management
- Clear visuals
- ""Right"" feel of Mechs.

CONS:
- I'm not fully into designs of the mechs, too much redneck. I totally prefer MechWarrior style.
- Missing building mech part. I'd like to see the complexity of MW. That what would keep me coming back to test new things.
- Very few maps"
Best VR game EU 10/10.
"19 years later, they still update the game.

They even updated the damn main menu!
They added widescreen support!
They fixed bugs here and there!
They updated the engine too!

If that's not worth the money, I don't know what is.

The game is pretty good too. Just saying."
"An adventure no bear was ever ready for!
Thrills! Excitement! Tears! Dance Off! Laughs!"
JUST PLAY
"You already have other reviewers telling you how the game plays; how the game is like FF Tactics and other games like that.  That's not what this review is.  This review is here to tell you what else you should know.  I'll keep it short and sweet.

This game is not a cash grab.  It is NOT a port.  Yes, it is on the phones, and it is an amazing game on the phones.  (All of the ""Kingturn"" games are.)  But this takes that game and actually Remasters it.  ""Remastered"" is not just a ""new and improved"" gimmick. 
Not only does the game looks better and plays better, but there are a S**T load of extras put in.  I was a huge fan of the Android versions and I helped with the testing of this version.   
There are new classes that you can give your main character, new skills, new game modes, new scenarios, new characters, etc, etc.  Theses things aren't just haphazardly added in.  They are actually fully fleshed out.  Each change that you have the option of using completely changes how the game plays and what your experience is like. This game was already a work of love, and this remaster is obviously much more of the same.  The developer cares and he is still updating and improving this game even after release.  Get this game and support him, then he can and will remaster his other games.  This is the type of developer we need more of:  One that puts out quality products for a fair price."

"As others have said, a more sci-fi oriented version of The Room games.  Nice little puzzles, no finding ridiculously hidden things that block your progress, a nice suggestion at a backstory.  Looking forward to the next in the series."
"There are games you want to play and then there are games you have to play.  This is a game you have to play.  

This is my first experience with the series, but being a huge fan of FFT, OB, and Xcom I have always wanted to give this a shot.

Roughly 100 hours later, my S/O hates this game, my front lawn is a little over grown and I have a sink full of dishes.

I still have a lot to do in the game but I think I can say without hesitation that this is the best tactical RPG I have ever played.

At first I was worried about the geo panels making me feel like I had to play each fight a certain way, but most of the time you can just kill them and go about your business.

The comedic story, beautiful sprites and endless game play make this one a real keeper.
I can see myself playing this one for years to come.

The only gripe is that you WILL need the strat guide AND gamefaqs to understand all the systems and mechanics in the game because, holy hell, are they neumerous and complex.

A few hints to make your life better:

Turn off Anti Aliasing if you get a multicolored rainbow line in the middle of your screen.

Turn on Vsync if your screen is tearing.

Leave the edge blur effects off.

You can throw enemies onto geo prizims to 1 shot destory them.

Dont worry about leveling up more than 4 or 5 characters your first time through the story.

Do not mess around with the item world until you beat the game (unless you have to for the story).

Ditch your starter prinnies asap, and level a male fist user, a mage, healer, a theif, and male warrior  with your main characters these will all you need on your first play through.

Do not worry about starting new characters with perfect stats or better versions of the class you currently have, you can restart them later as any new class and carry stats from their current level over as many times as you want (google transmigrating disgaea).

On first playthrough, angelic main character is the best one to ask the assembly for a healer and a mage because of next tip.

Once a character creates another one at the assembly, it can learn all of their spells by standing beside the new character in battle and casting the new character\'s spell(s) 5 times; this works with all spells at all levels.

Bribes in the dark assembly are cumulative, that is, the more you bribe, the higher your influence gets over time.

The dark assembly can be entered and exited at no penalty to re roll influence for that session.

Talk to your all of your castle's vassals in each chapter, they sometimes reward you."
The biggest troll is that they said the game would leave early access in six months five years ago.

[h1] First Impressions [/h1] 
Mutant Football League (MFL) comes as a late successor to a couple of mutant-based sports games released on the Sega Genesis back in the early 90's. I grew up a Nintendo kid so I never played them, but the idea always seemed interesting to me, as you'd purposely aim to tear your opponents limb from limb. These games were so popular that a cartoon was made, which lasted for 40 episodes, so seeing it return doesn't seem out of place. Plus, I now get a chance to experience a sports game of such a violent nature, so that's a win for me. Will the mutants fare as well though?


[h1] Gameplay [/h1] 
In spite of coming out decades after the original game, MFL maintains its roots. True, it does benefit from a better user interface, and the perspective has increased so you can see further down field, but they've kept the 7 players per team on field mechanic, instead of the usual 11. I'm not sure I understand the aversion to a full-sized team since modern hardware could handle it just fine, but I suppose it's part of the branding. It wouldn't be the Mutant league if the teams played by the books though, and I was surprised when I checked the original game and found much of what's included in this game was available back then. For instance, being able to bribe and kill the ref, calling dirty tricks to kill opposing players, and winning by forfeit if all a teams' quarterbacks die. 

The different modes available in MFL include a [b]Training Camp[/b] and [b]Practice Mode[/b] so you can learn the basic controls and mechanics of football, which even I already knew about, though it didn't go into as much detail about the specifics of MFL as I'd have wanted. You can play [b]Exhibition[/b] or [b]Online[/b] games, which are just one-offs. The [b]Playoffs[/b] and [b]Mayhem Bowl[/b] have the flair of being the big game, but since there's not much preamble, it comes off as just another [b]Exhibition[/b] match to me. If you have only the normal game, [b]Season Mode[/b] would be your chance to select a team to play through several matches, the playoffs, and the [b]Mayhem Bowl[/b], assuming you don't blow it. This greater sense of investment does have a stronger payoff though, and you can change the settings in-between games. As I was provided with the [b]Dynasty[/b] version to review, I had the opportunity to develop a team of my own, building up players who improved with every successful 1st down, touchdown, and quarterback sack. With the budget allotted to me, I had to buy and trade my players, spend money to upgrade their stats, and resurrect them if they died in play. All while staying profitable by winning games, lest I'd be fired.

[h1] Controls [/h1] 
It isn't necessary to use a controller, although it is the recommended way to play MFL. With the controls changing between kicking and playing offense vs defense, I won't break down all of the inputs in the game. Between the [b]Training Camp[/b] and being able to check this information from the [b]Pause Menu[/b], it's not necessary anyways. Either way, aside from some initial confusion, the controls are straightforward enough and work properly. 


[h1] Story [/h1] 
Although each team riffs on a real-life counterpart, and tends to have some kind of theme, such as [b]Galaxy Chaos[/b] being made up of aliens, there's no story elements to the game. I thought there might have been some in [b]Dynasty Mode[/b], but that isn't the case either. 

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2292593491
[h1] Graphics [/h1] 
MFL has a cartoony art style, which isn't surprising with the violent antics that take place. Most of the time you're pulled away from the action, and don't see the player models or their interactions with one another very closely. However, when you zoom in to watch their celebrations and taunts, the animations look smooth, and the models aren't too bad. Other parts of the game don't have as much polish though, such as the audience that you barely see at all, and the field hazards, which look pretty flat. 


[h1] Sound Design [/h1] 
For the majority of the game, there isn't any music to listen to. Instead, you'd be listening to the commentary made by the announcers, who do create the feeling of watching the game on Sunday night. However, if you decide to turn it off, there isn't accompanying background music to bolster your gameplay. The sound effects from tackles have impact to them, but some over the top screams during kills may have been nice. I wasn't a fan of the crying child sound effect that comes up every so often. 

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2292584851
[h1] Pros [/h1] 
🌟 There's a wide range of options available: AI difficulty, how quickly the game goes, time limit for each quarter, whether dirty plays are allowed, how brutal attacks are, if players can die permanently, etc. 
🌟 Most of the game modes allow you to play with 4 people, though a few, such as online matches, are for 2 people. 


[h1] Cons [/h1] 
❌ I'm surprised there's not a highlight reel at the end of games or to showcase the spectacle of killing players. It's one thing to include such action in a game, but it really would benefit from more razzle dazzle. At most you might see a pile of blood and an arm drop off. Plus, the player who gets the kill doesn't have blood splatters on his uniform. 
❌ With how much you'd theoretically play this game, across multiple seasons, the announcers' commentary runs out quickly. It doesn't take long before they're repeating the same bits, oftentimes within the same game. You'll want to turn the volume down on this before long. 
❌ You can't earn all of the achievements, because they were broken by updates, with no intention of fixing them.
❌ Even if you get [b]Dynasty Mode[/b], it doesn't include all of the DLC.


[h1] Tips [/h1]
🔍 Field hazards are always on the edges of the field, with a few exceptions, because it would otherwise impede the two teams lining up for the play. Depending on which ones they are, I'll avoid kicking or returning along the edges, because my AI teammates will be injured or killed. The fire pits aren't so bad, but landmines and the worms are much worse. 
🔍 Whenever the ref calls a bogus penalty against your team, go to the dirty plays and either bribe the ref or kill him. You'll never be able to score a touchdown otherwise. 
🔍 If you reduce how long each quarter is, there will be far less kills in the game, because it takes time to chip away at their health. 


[h1] Final Thoughts [/h1] 
Playing MFL has been fun, but it doesn't take long for the gameplay to feel repetitive. Having only 7 players on the field limits the possible plays you're able to pull off, so you'll wind up using plays you have a successful track record with multiple times. Utilizing your dirty tricks for specific situations, clobbering defenseless players in the short duration available to you, and countering a bribed ref immediately as it comes up becomes a routine instead of feeling like the exciting edge otherwise unavailable in other football games. When something occurs every time, it becomes a new norm, and doesn't have that sense of being exciting. 

After dabbling with [b]Dynasty Mode[/b], I'd say it helps provide more motivation and novelty to maintain interest in the game. However, since you don't create or customize the players design, working with pre-made teams and players, I don't know that it measures up against other offerings. I recommend MFL, but think the experience would be better if you had someone else joining in.

"Well, the achievements here don't actually go in favour of the game itself.. as a curator writes, namely For Achievement Hunters Only, ""Just collect everything and break stuff. Even a fat cat and a dumb old dog (or a dumb old fat CatDog) can 100% this one with ease.""
The game's made in Unity and you can modify some graphics and resolution options in the first menu.. even though the windowed mode is quite buggy for me at least, since it leaves two blue bands on the top and lower part of the screen for the whole game.
You're introduced by a nice cutscene and you'll be prompted to choose the language (six are available) and the way in which your cat will jump - high or double (I'm always for the double jump since the '90s by the way).
After you close the game in order to uncheck the windowed option (by the way some resolution settings still show in my gaming laptop the two horizontal blue bars), under an awesome piano melody you'll be transported into the first level.
It takes place in a graveyard at night and the tutorial is nicely introduced through it - you'll play basically a platformer, controlling a cat..
Ok, the intro actually is relevant and very interesting, and the graphics are great to me. I don't want to rush always into the gameplay!
Anyways.. the story's quite deep although it's always ironic and humorous, with lots of famous cats to free and greatly written dialogues! :)
For the gameplay part, let's go back a bit, it's a platformer - normal keys, not remappable unfortunately, to move and jump around. The fish you'll collect will act as an in-game money and the game will get deeper and deeper keeping at the same time a great indie/handmade flavour.
The game supports joypad controls, but actually it has a bad point in my opinion in the non-remappable keys, as I said - you'll not be able to play in WASD since your weapon, the basic claws, will be activated only through pressing the Q key making it impossible not to use the directional keys.. which is something I don't like, I prefer to play left-handed.
The controls are responsive, don't misunderstand me - the problem is that you can't remap them.
Anyways, going deep through the game you'll have to deal with the usual 2D platformer features: jumping to avoid enemies and to collect fish, swiping to kill the other animals, holding up to climb the walls or to hide behind objects in order not to be spotted and so on.
The game shines under all these aspects - you'll have checkpoints, awesome dialogues and encounters with other cats, boss battles.. yeah, there are many things I'd have fixed - more saves, remappable controls, shorter levels, HP/health bars on enemies and bosses.. but if it's taken as an indie platformer, this one definitely goes straight to the core.
And you really don't need to love cats to enjoy it xD (actually I don't like cats at all).. but it's really hilarious and on the other hand, it's definitely challenging!
Don't expect an awesome platformer (the levels are quite long, but there's a few of them and the whole game won't last more than some hours), but if you like the genre and you're willing to take part in this funny adventure this one for sure it's an indie game to support."
"A fun, albeit short, game for what it is. The platforming controls well, the music is nice, and there is a certain charm that comes with the nod to older game mechanics. I'd honestly recommend using a controller with this game.

Definitely worth checking out if you're in the market for a short game."
"A very simple game at the moment, but reminiscent of Rimworld mixed with Dawn of Man. Can definitely see this being one of my staple games once it gets a bit more development time."
"Was pleasantly surprised. A full fishing game for the price of UFS dlc, you can't go wrong especially if you previously owned Pro Fishing as I got it for 80p!! Even at full price it's worth it, and if you're a glass half full sort of a person you'll get a lot of fun and relaxation out of this game. The graphics are sharp and there is a workable clutch system that does the job. The fish look the part and splash and jump out of the water. The sound is nice. Yes it's a mobile port (what do you expect for the price?), but it's a successful port imo. 
You'll start off in Poland floatfishing bread on a size 16 catching roach, bleak and crucians. My advice is to get your level up quickly so you can improve your tackle. One of the best ways to do this once you've caught enough small fish (doesn't take long) is to fish dough for bream/silver bream, caddis larvae for barbel and bream and big roach, and cherry for nice big chub (make sure you've upgraded your gear a bit first).
When you get into bigger fish like 6ib bream/barbel and 5Ib chub you'll hear your clutch scream as the fish takes line, you can tighten or loosen the clutch with the mouse wheel. The rod tip bends nicely on the quality fish. The physics seem improved to Pro fishing.
With each fish landed you get the choice of money and some xp, or forsake the money and double the xp. Having first got some cash in the bank I opted to level up fast to get better gear.
There are lots of places to go and eventually you'll get access to N. American places and sea fishing. Australia will be added soon too. Boats can be hired reasonably. All in all a good effort and certainly an improvement on their previous game which didn't go too well. Looking forward to eventually battling with Sturgeon and Marlin!"
i like it but it needs better new player guidance
"worth the price, if you like difficult bosses this game is perfect"
"Awesome games,  play exactly like you imagine. It's a lego game that follow the story of the movie. Each cutscene is directly took from the movie. For the gameplay, I heard some people says it looks like minecraft, but i't doesn't. It's a Lego Game and it exactly the same formula it always been. The game's funny, beautiful and is a BLAST when playing in couch co-op. 

If you were on the edge about buying yet another Lego Game, buy it now!"

It's been years since my first encounter with the game [i]Doodle God[/i] at Kongregate, a lovely and brilliantly creative casual flash game. The game was initially released for iPhone/iPod Touch, then kept being adapted for various platforms, until it finally arrived to Steam. It makes me feel kinda nostalgic, heck, even old, seeing this particular game here. Well, congratulations, Joy Bits! From humble beginnings, to eventual glory you have come! You know something is particularly good when you see it through platforms.

The game is astonishingly simple: you are the God of the Doodle Universe, and one day, you get bored of your unused omnipotence. You decide to create four basic hermetic elements: air, water, fire and earth. But looking around, you still find the place to be quite desolate, and come up with a brilliant idea: what if you were to combine these basic elements to create new ones? And thereon, your journey to populate the earth with various creatures, inventions, phenomenon and even notions begin.

All so simple, right? Well, it starts simple enough, but you'll have four distinct chapters in the game, which will eventually accumulate to 249 elements to discover! Phew! Some of the combinations you'll come up with, are elementary and quite obvious. But as the game progresses, it forces you to think for the abstract, or even absurd. All combinations make some kind of sense, but the kind it would make sense is sometimes open to criticism. After a while, you'll find yourself thinking through puns and farces; and then you'll know that you are getting to the interesting part.

As a casual puzzle game, [i]Doodle God[/i] is really creative and fun. It is easy to get immersed and come up with odd combinations to see if it would work. Most of the time, the game doesn't disappoint. Aside the main game, there are various puzzles to figure out a specific element's creation; and quests concerning a tale or an objective - like surviving a deserted island or rescuing the princess from the dragon through our element combination powers.

There has been a rage about the game here on Steam, sometime ago, concerning microtransactions. There was an inbuilt energy system which would prevent you from playing endlessly, and hints concerning possible combinations would be bought through microtransactions. Considering the game is free in various other platforms, Steam users boycotted the game furiously during the time. You see, the game has a price here in Steam - which can be directly justified, since there are many options, both competitive and questwise here, which are not included in other versions. But continuously paying for the game that you have actually bought once? That was a bad call for Joy Bits' marketing department. Well, I am happy to declare that Joy Bits heard their fans' voice and removed both energy system and all microtransactions. Now, you can enjoy every little bit of the game indefinitely once you purchase it.

Can I recommend it? Without a blink! It is one of the most entertaining casual puzzle games I've ever played. It would be worthwhile, even for only to discover quotes attached to related elements. You can try the game as a phone app too, if you wouldn't like to pay for it here, but it was my personal call to support the developer, since praises they received for the game didn't bring them much monetary gain until Steam. After the Steam version, the game turned into a whole franchise with various new games like [i]Doodle Devil[/i] or [i]Doodle Mafia[/i].

"I almost bought this game from Gamersgate, but I had heard it was impossible to play on newer systems. I borrowed a copy from a friend and, sure enough, it would not start. After developer credits it would crash to desktop every single time. I tried all sorts of fixes, but nothing made the game work. I had no choice but to accept the upsetting fact that it was just completely incompatible with modern software. I was very sad about this because, being a fan of other Total War games, I really wanted to play this one and experience first-hand the evolution of the series.

Can you believe my luck? A week later Creative Assembly/Sega release this game on Steam, updated to run on my OS: Windows 8.1 64-bit, and it works perfectly! Not only that, but they also release Medieval: Total War; which also works! That's not all. The main menu screen is fixed to default resolution, but the in-game resolution can be maxed out to 1920 x 1080, and it looks stunning. Game is still simple-looking, but highly detailed and addicting.

This was a very nice surprise that caught me totally off guard. They've made me one of the happiest gamers today!"
"Out of the 100's of games I own on Steam this has to be one of my favourites. There is nothing really demanding or challenging, I play it because it's damn relaxing."
"Organ Quarter is such a breath of fresh air and at the same time it is very reminiscent of the first Resident Evil and Silent Hill 2. Finally a real survivor horror titlle that isn't just another shooting gallery. It plays like an actual video game with the enemies spouting out very creepy soundz from the underground (like 6 feet under) and they move around in an even creepier walk. There is a good amount of different enemies and bosses alike. Like others have said, this game is not about cheap jump scares just a full on sinister experience which makes this one of the best Horror VR titles to date. I have only played about 3 and 1/2 hours (still haven't played the first boss) but from what I have played feels like a AAA game by a AAA developer and even the environments made by the developers is quite unsettling and disturbing. If you are looking for something that has similarties to the 90's old skool survival horror yet is still fresh and loaded with the macabre don't look further and just pick this game up."
Fun 3-5 hour casual time-waster.  Worth the price.  No VR needed.
"This is and will forever be the greatest game of all time. My friends and I had a totally bodacious experience when we went through the multiplayer section of the game. The constant oogling, multiple plot twists, endless variety of mini games, and completely amazing lead character, makes the game the greatest there has ever been and ever will be. I pray to Aunt Bunko that they will release an outstanding sequel to this already amazing title. While the sequel will never match the glory of the first is shall provide a yet another amazing adventure in this MMO environment.

Action Henk is a racing platformer developed by RageSquid studios which recently left Early Access. In Action Henk you play as Henk, obviously, an out of shape 90s action hero trying to defeat his nemesis Kentony! Run, jump, slide and wall jump your way to victory with one of the five playable characters. Action Henk's gameplay is sort of like Speedrunners meets the Trials series, I'd describe it as Trials without the bikes.

+Nice graphics
+Hilariously imagined characters
+Fun gameplay, it really has the ""one more try for gold"" feel to it
+Some great references throughout ranging from Thunderbirds, to MIB to the Sanic meme
+Over 70 tracks (not to mention all of the community made ones)
+Five playable characters, each with different skins to unlock
+Great soundtrack
+Lots of replayability, especially if you want to have a gold medal for each map
+A good level editor
+A fun hookshot mechanic which is introduced later in the game
+Difficulty increases at a good rate
+Great controls (I played with KB&M)
+After completing a level you can challenge your friends to try and beat your time 
+Friendly devs

-At some parts in later levels it can be difficult to know what you're supposed to do unless you watch how the ghost does it first

Verdict:
9

Action Henk is an absolutely fantastic racing platformer with nice graphics, great characters, addictive gameplay and loads of levels to play. If you're a fan of Speedrunners or trials this is an absolute must buy!

"It is for my part, unplayble. You start with the main menu, which features a ""play"" and a ""eixt"" button ( yes, 'eixt', not exit). You press the play button, get a simple tutorial on how to play the game. You complete the first level. Press continue, and get booted to the main menu. Press play again. You are back at the first level. Clear it again. Get booted again. This repeats indefinetly. Reinstalling and verifying files didnt do anything."
"1998 was the year of [i]Grand Theft Auto[/i] (the original one with the top-down view), [i]Planet of death(pod)[/i] and [i]Vangers[/i]. Vangers didn't catch on much back then, because there wasn't any genre it fit. Even if it does some things similarly to GTA (open world top-down driving game with missions and unstructured gameplay), its premise and game world are much more confusing, and most reviewers and players couldn't warm up to it, though some did. (Actually, that probably hasn't changed.)

What sets Vangers apart? 

Voxels: Vangers has been implemented with a voxel-like world (that was before the prevalence of polygon-crunching graphics cards), which means that the terrain doesn't have a surface made of textured polygons, but is sculpted out of tiny cubes (like square pixels make up a digital photograph, but in 3D). (Think minecraft with finer grains.)  This means that you can deform the terrain: vehicles leave tracks, weapons make craters, you can move under water, through tunnels (sometimes hard to spot in the top-down view) and, with the right equipment, even burrow along like a mole. Unfortunately, this is also the reason why Vangers still runs at 800x600: if you upped the resolutions, either everything would be very small, or the Voxels would appear larger, and everything would still be blocky.

SciFi: Vangers is set in a confusing world, or rather a ""Chain"" of worlds (do read the ""preface"" eventually), with seasons that affect gameplay, weird installations, the purpose of which is initially unknown, and strange creatures that talk in riddles. You need to discover much of  the gameplay as you go along.

So how do you get a feel for the game? Review the controls in the options - you will need to move, turn your vehicle over and use the KiD a lot. Set the game to fullscreen. Then click yourself (somewhat to the right) through the prologue into the buying screen, pick up a shipment of Nymbos, exit the burrow, click on the lower right panel to set your compass for Incubator, and take off. (I set my camera to zoom and tilt, but not to rotate, because  it is very easy to get disoriented.) You'll find that with your small, lightweight car, terrain matters a lot. There are roads, some obvious, some not so much, and unfortunately, you need to stay out of the way of stronger Vangers for the time being. Reach Incubator, sell the Nymbos, get some Phlegma, trade it back to Podish, buy better cars and equipment, ask the councellors about the things you saw, figure out how they work and how to reach other worlds in the chain, take part in races, take down other Vangers and loot them, become a motorized Scifi mercenary.

If you like off-road driving and can keep going in the  face of confusion (and if you don't mind a time machine trip back to when screens had 15"", 640x480 was a good game resolution, and 800x600 looked definitely wonderful - and games had to ask before saving 64MB of persistent world), [i]Vangers[/i] will reward you with huge and deep world full of surprises -- and driving.

I can safely say that there hasn't been any game like Vangers since 1998, because if there had been, I would have played it. ([i]Hard Truck Apocalypse[/i], also published by Buka, comes close, but it doesn't have voxel terrain and isn't nearly as strange as Vangers.) I'm very happy that it has been overhauled to run on modern systems. 

P.S.: I just found my old Vangers mousepad with the yellow and blue liquid and the floating mechos!

--------------------
I just wrote the following in a forum post, it may help inform your buying decision.
[quote]So some people may be thinking, ""that's an interesting game, but chances are high I won't like it much"" and then conclude that they'll buy it if it ever goes below 4$ or whatever. Those of us who know and love Vangers know the game is worth more to us, but I can understand that people who are curious are reluctant to buy.

In that regard, if you like top-down off-road racing, with small vulnerable vehicles that can roll over and right themselves and do both small and really long jumps with a built-in spring device that charges up, you probably won't regret buying this for the full price, because if you get frustrated with the alien SciFi, you'll be able to just go and tool around the area some more in your mecho and have fun.[/quote]"

"I love this game, I use to play it when I was younger with my mom, of course that's before steam was even around lol, but I'm glad bigfish and steam got together and brought this amazing Mystery game to the community, This game you have to sit there and try finding things like you're playing Ispy or something, and then to be able to continue to the next level you have to solve puzzles, its really cool and fun."
"An hour or so into playing, I felt that Evergarden was a fun, yet repetitive puzzle game. 

About three hours in, I started to realize how clever this game was. I began to notice certain elements for the first time, even though they'd been available to me since I'd started. 

Five hours in, I became obsessed. How were others getting such high scores? What could I do to perfect my strategy?

Around eight hours in, I accepted how little I understood and how much more there was to go. I was still peeling back layers, always aware that a new strategy was just beyond the horizon.

At the time of writing this, I am close to ten hours in. I have not completed the main adventure due to my need to rise higher on the leaderboard. I am addicted to this play style and in no rush to find an ending.

The design and music are beautiful. The game itself is addicting and therapeutic. Highly recommend."

"I think i really needed a game like this, because ive been playing this non stop all day (christmas 2020 lol).

As a ""Bullet hell"" game with 1st person sections while not perfect, it feels polished, and is really fun. 

Gameplay is simple, the ""2d"" part is like similar games, enemies come, you avoid their bullets, you shoot them down.
There are no ""bombs"" and only 4 powerups (shield, helper planes, max weapons power and extra life, that makes your plane super big, but will go back to normal after 1 hit), In my opinion the powerups are a lackluster.

The coolest part is the ""immersion"" sublevels, there are 2 per level, where you get into a 1st or 3rd person view kinda on rails, as in you can move around but not control the speed. 
When in the cockpit view, you can see a working radar and other little details that are very nice.

I found it cool that the immersive missions arent all a ""repeat"" of the same mission, they try to change things up a little bit each mission, but like one time you are inside the cockpit, then you are outside the plane, then you are in a fixed turret... not huge changes, but im ok because that way its not overwhelming.

My only complaint is that for some reason my weapons powerups dont translate to this immersive parts, and im always stuck with this lame slow machine gun.

For progression, aside from the story missions, You grab coins during the missions, that you can then use to buy improvements to your ship weapons and defenses. (i LOVED that its not a 1hit death, your ship gradually starts to break down the more hits you get, and slowly regenerates after a bit)

I felt the progression was on spot, like i started upgrading depending on what i think i needed help with. (but upgrading into the coin multiplier as soon as possible is a good idea)

I think it should take like 1.5~2hrs to finish the game just playing each mission once, which i think its a really really good for the price. 

Im not really sure about the time, because i went back and replayed a LOT of levels again and again, repeating levels i found particularly fun, and... honestly to grind levels that give tons of coins. so i could improve my ship faster. Instead of focusing on finishing the story... by the time i did that... i was pretty upgraded so it wasnt hard...

But make no mistake, the game is NOT an easy game, later levels really get hectic.

I even started going for the highscores, im not made for them, but im not too shabby :)

Definitively not a purchase i regret, i got it in the Nostalgia VR bundle and i think it was a bargain. Totally recommended."
"An absolute masterpiece. 10/10. 

21 deaths, 22 hours, and I felt every minute and mistake deeply.

In all my life I don't expect to play anything quite like this ever again.

Perhaps nothing had so effectively captured despair, attempted to, or attempted to understand what it means to attempt to. If it has, I doubt it was done in such an engaging and striking way.

Truly pushes and expands the medium, in a way only something introspective and truly designed can do. 

Should I come off overly dramatic that is only perfectly fitting."
"I usually don't write reviews, I know I should. 
I just read the sad news that there won't be a second season for this game. I just want to recommend the game, as it is, to anyone. The concept and execution are brilliant and the developers help players that have technical issues with the game. I rate this game 110/100 would totally recommend, for the price you get so much fun. My wife is not even a gamer though she really enjoyed the experience of playing with me. She has been asking me for months ""any news with eon altar? When is the next episode coming?"" Now i'll have to tell her there won't be anymore episodes :( or maybe there will be if this game gets its much deserved attention. 

Thanks to the developers for the amazing game, so hard to make my wife play vidya with me, she actually enjoyed this one. If you are looking for a game to share with your friends and family that might not be that much into gaming this is the right game for you!"
"I've played this game at a very convenient time. I am currently starting an electronics course in my univercity and this game kinda prepared me for what is about to come.

The game has some serious problems:
It looks like s♥♥t
Voice acting is cringy
At some points gameplay is very repetitive
Some puzzles appear twice

But I REALLY liked this game anyway! Becouse It has something that no other game have. 
This game's message is that we need to change a way how to teach students, kids, or anybody. The game presents itself as a... you know... GAME. But after a while it stops beeing a game and starts to tell us information that is usefull in the real world. But it still remains entertaining.

The graphics are bad... But they are bad at an exact level to give me a heavy nostalgia for the games that I used to play when I was a kid. It has a strong 2007 vibe.

This game is flawed but I still really like it.
I guess I can say that this review was a little bit.. Weird...
hee hee"
"I originally got this game for my children.  And then I shoved them aside and played through the game myself, cause I was hooked.  I grew up loving both Legos and Marvel.  This is a fantastic merger of both.  

Pros:
- This game has a lighthearted storyline that doesn't take itself too seriously.  
- The antics and quips made by the characters are humorous and satiristically appropriate.  
- Kid appropriate means that I can sit down with my children for an hour or two to 'bond.'
- Marvel.

Neutral:
- Gameplay is typical of most lego games; get coins, find gold/red bricks, unlock characters.

Cons:
- It does get a bit repetative sometimes; gameplay and 'flavor' dialogue.
- There are a few bugs still in the game.  Though they don't crop up all that often, it is annoying to have to quit a level simply because the bug prevented your advance.
- Flight controls were terrible (or I'm old, and just don't get it)."
"A great follow up to the previous game on Hiragana, and it follows the same principle.

This one teaches you Katakana without needing to know any hiragana or kanji.

I think Katakana War is great for beginners and those that already know some katakana and want to brush up on their skills.

Highly recommened.

And don't believe Owen in the game - Japanese corn soup in a can is awesome."
"First there was DUNE 2 in 1992.
Then there was WARCRAFT 1 in 1994.
And then COMMAN & CONQUER 1 in 1995.
That lead to the explosion of the Real Time Strategy Genre. 
What followed was the Golden Age of RTS Games.
Age of Empires, KKND, Empire Earth, Starcraft, Total Annihilation, Dark Reign, War Wind, Warzone 2100 and so much more Games flooded the Gaming Scene.
What once began as a One Player Game, went more and more to Multiplayer and took  Millions into its Ban.
Sadly the Singleplayer Aspect went more and more into the Background.
Until now.

Welcome to FIVE NATIONS.

Don´t get me wrong, i love how so many People like to play RTS Games online, but time after time i was really missing simple One Player Maps, all guided by a cool Storycampaign like in the first Command and Conquer Games.
It seems like FIVE NATION heard my wish.

Unlike Command and Conquer, that played mostly on the Ground, FIVE NATIONS plays in Space.  And here begins the wonderfull Retro Aspect.
You start with nearly Zero. You have to manage Base Building.
Find 4 different Ressources like in Asteroids and extract them as fast as you can to raise your little Empire. Produce fastly your Units and get them to action.  The Faster the better, the more effective. No exuses, use your time and act.

You have a big but well arranged variety of Units and Buildings and a nice done Tech Tree. And as the Name says, you can control 5 Nations, different Species, each with its own Style and Design and also with their own Storys. 
56 Story fully voiced Missions are waiting for you. Exciting, diversified with nice Characters.

The control with Mouse and Keyboard is very smooth and typical Old School for example the Group Control. Easy click and double clicking for moving and attacking.  Good Overview on a Mini Map. 

The Graphics are really nice and i love the Design of the Units. 
The great Soundtrack fits in very, very good.

FIVE NATIONS also gives you 20 Skirmish Maps and a Map Builder to maximize your Fun.

What can i say more?
FIVE NATIONS feels like a Time Machine back to the Golden Age of RTS Games. 
A Single Player Campaign with the Focus on an exciting Story, guided by some Cut Scenes. 
The Thrill of building up your Base fastly, before the first Enemy Units are coming for you. The trial and error from new units or Installations. 
The typical Goosebump Feeling like once in Command & Conquer. 

And i also agree with the other Reviews. It is a really low price for the Content that is waiting for you. Really amazing.

If you like the Good old RTS Games and are disappointed from  newer Games, then this is the Game you have been waiting for.

A very big Thanks to the Developer for the DeLorean to the Golden Age of RTS Game. 
You did an awesome job and put so much Love into FIVE NATIONS.
Thanks, just thanks.

And thank YOU for Reading. 

Oh wait! Wait, wait, wait!
My dear Friend Ajay made a nice Video for the Game. 
Have a Look and enjoy!

"Sometimes sad, sometimes adorable, sometimes confusing,[i] just like love itself [/i], game with great arts and sweet soundtrack.

[h1]LoveChoice[/h1]

First of all, this game is not just any other game which you can play whenever you'd like. To really feel the mood of the game you should log out from all your social networks, keep for later all your usual workday routine and hide from the others on your closet with your laptop. Put your headphones on and read aloud like all that is happening to your character is really happening to you. 

The game has 3 separate stories: Love:Game, Love:Distance and Love:Detective.
First story is about a couple which has met at the game development convent. Game describe the events like first meeting, getting closer to each other, first date, first disagreement, life together and so on. 
Throughout this episode you would have solve true mysteries like ""What to watch on your first date"", ""What to say, when your opponent is upset about something"" and others. At the end you will get a letter from your girlfriend which will tell you how good was your relationship and you will get one of two endings.

Second story is about a boy and a girl who met as a really young kids. And gosh, your relationship could never be more complicated then that. Throughout the whole story there will be more and more obstacles to overcome which is really hard to deal with even sitting in front of a monitor. 

And the last story is about a married couple where you, as a wife, beginning to feel that your relationship is becoming more distant then is ever were. Futhermore, you think that your husband is cheating on you. And when he will go to work you will become a real detective to understand what is really going on."
"If you're a fan of the developer's previous games [i]Tasty Planet[/i] and [i]Tasty Blue[/i], this is more of that.

If you're not, it's a game where you control a tiny creature and eat things smaller than you to slowly grow bigger, so that you can eat bigger things and grow bigger still; it's like [i]Katamari[/i] but with vore. The game is level-based, and there is no continuity between levels; you can end one by eating a car, and begin the next too small to eat a rat. Most levels have a target size to grow to, but some change it up and have you eating all of a certain type of object, penalizing you for eating anything else. These levels are also odd in that they have you playing hero to the people you've been eating.

Each level is timed, and you're graded and awarded up to three stars based primarily on how quickly you finish. Bonus levels are locked until you earn certain numbers of stars. Many of the stars are too difficult for me, so I haven't unlocked any yet.

This game has eight playable characters with their own themed sets of levels, with each character introduced by a cute comic strip. To move on to the next, you must complete the current set from beginning to end, not including bonus levels.

TL;DR: [i]Katamari[/i], [i]Agar.io[/i], etc. with strict level progression."
The fish do be walking tho
"Pretty different than Starbound/Terraria. Unique on its own. I love the skill trees/professions level. Blend of skyrim and RPG 2D. Is it worth it at this stage? Yeah I would say so. For 10$, and early access stage, it's incredibly well done. Not much bugs that I've encountered so far. Content wise, mmm it's pretty good for 10hours or so (if you venture/do dungeons), probably more if you just play super casually and build things.

Pros
+ skill trees, profession levels
+nice crafting
+combat is fun (granted in the beginning, you'll be constantly backing), you can roll, triple jump, power punch, blocking, ect. AND the upgrades for those skill
+very RPG, craft, build, hunger/stamina/mana bar
+animations is smooth, though the character limbs are kinda oddly moving at times. Very ragdoll like (all parts move)
+seems like the devs are active/pushing out patches. So for now, I have hope that this will not fail like the majority of EA games I've supported. /crosses fingers and toes

Cons
- WORLD NOT RESPAWNING/RENEWING. probably a MAJOR one. Devs said they might reconsider . .""might"". This should be the first one on the list. It will be a problem the longer the players play the game as things can easily become barren and stale. Since nothing respawns; no renewable resources such as wool/meat/ect. For an RPG game, keeping things ""alive"" and ""fresh"" is one of the main point.
[strike]Corpses not despawning.[/strike] 
-not much craftables, it stops after gold bar but I've seen the codings, so looks like there will be lots more, but not yet. . .
-I can't be a translucent ghost (no pale/white skin)
-farming time is irritating. It uses REAL time, most of the crops are 2hrs and up, fruit trees are 10hrs. This is a big one for me, as I like to just be able to chill after my killing spree(which I can't really do since things I kill don't respawn) and go kill crops instead.
-only one town to visit, [strike]4 or so dungeons. and a lot of ""wilderness""[/strike] now 7 dungeons and wilderness
-no magic .. . 
-forced save. only one slots, can't choose when to save.
-no home mark so I couldn't find my way home. Some kind soul in discussion put in his starting location, so I managed to get home.
-there's this guy wearing pot armor following me in this part of town. He's scaring me. Sometimes he says he's hungry so I tried to give him food at first (you can't), kept saying people throw stones at him, then tell me he got a gift for me ""it's stones"".


small amount of content. it's good enough for ""now"" since it's in EA, but I definitely would love to see more craftables (especially functional chandeliers, better/prettier and smaller storage chests. Be able to place decorations on table surfaces (like end table/wardrobe/ basically flat table surfaces), increase stack amount in some items stack (ore stack is 100, feels like it should be 1000 like the building blocks, furs is only 20 max stack--which is annoying as heck). Big water flask and small water flask is exactly the same amount, there should be a difference

tips for new players: wolves are scary in the beginning. it WILL kill you. you can reset the shopkeeper's inventory by reloading the game. can switch your bags by changing in in the character screen (thanks to kind soul that helped me. I love you). Make sure you remember where your home/base is!, also maybe build base near the end of the map for easy travel."
"The game is rage inducing not because of its complexity but from a combination of things outside of the players control.  Spawns are randomly deadly, upgrades are sometimes harmful, the repetative music is grating, the ""tips"" at the bottom of the screen mock you, and the controls which are supposed to be the highlight of this game are instead something that continuously find a way to get in your way.  The only pros I can see are that the game can be cheap when on sale, the game is technically a +1 for your game hording count, and the achievements are truly something for those completionist sadists willing to torture themselves."
"Great minimalist adventure game! This is one of the few mobile games that actually deserves the title of ""game."" I hope that expansions/mods become available someday. 

Whenever you just want to fill in some time, and you've overplayed solitaire and minesweeper, this rogue-like gives you a taste of basic adventure gaming, while still offering something fun and challenging. It even has a little bit of backstory that doesn't impose on the gameplay itself. A difficult game to put down once you're on a roll."
"This is a fun mystery game that requires you to put together clues from interviews and case files. However due to the games structure getting stuck is going to happen and the lack of specific guides makes getting the proper ending difficult.
If you are stuck at around 270+ clips found then it may be worth just finding the keywords from the clips at /steamapps/common/The List/The_List/Content/Movies
If you are going to do this I recommend that you [spoiler] do clip 112 last. [/spoiler]
Overall it was a good experience with an excellent story and soundtrack that was definitely worth the price."
"I was excited to purchase the dlc, thinking that it was going to be a new bunch of puzzles like their other game The Greatest Painter (which I love). However the in-game link to the store page didn't work (fortunately in the end!) and I looked in the discussions for any similar experiences.... didn't see any but discovered thanks to one good person that the dlc for this game happens to be the exact same game of The Greatest Painter. And there is only a teeny tiny disclaimer at the end of this game's store page which I had totally missed. Dodgy af. So no, I cannot recommend this game unfortunately coz of the blatant greed."
"This game is really addicting.

It's essentially a rogue-like, but you can force any build you want pretty consistently, so the main thing you'll end up wanting, once you've unlocked everything, is a better score (for me at least it was like that) but it's also fun to try to make some random builds work, and there are a LOT of different builds with very different gameplays.

The game scales infinitely (only the endless mode is available for now) but if you manage to beat the boss wave 100 you can say you had a good run, after that you won't encounter new enemies (for now) and everything will get progressively harder. If your build is good enough you can still reach waves really high like 500. 

When starting a run, you'll be able to choose a weapon, a shield and a body type. There are a lot of them and they each have their own uniqueness which makes them feel very different from one another.

For example : you can have a basic build where you'll simply shoot your overpowered, overstacked weapon but you'll end up being really squishy, or you can go the full tank route and just crash into things to make them explode. You can also get ""constructs"" which are like pets that will destroy things for you or even copy your weapon to shoot it themselves!

Overall a great game with a lot more updates planned, it's also very pretty to look at and really satisfying when your build utterly destroys everything on the screen."
"You better dust off your platforming skills for this one kids. It is the Mega Man you remember, difficulty and all (although some new additions do take a bit of the edge off). The graphics look clean and crisp and the new/old enemies have the classic charm that made mega man great. So far, I am impressed. Just be ready to die a lot."
"I am not a big fan of spending money on ports/revamps of flash games, but some titles (and developers) deserve it based on my fun with the flash version and quality of the devs. Knightmare Tower is one such game.

I love the flash games Juicy Beast has put out in the past. They know their audience and they know what flash games should be about: easy to get into, but hard to master fun. 

Check out the flash version on Kongregate or Armor Games before you decide to buy. If you enjoy it, Juicy Beast well-deserve your money for this rebuild."
"I only bought this today and I've played it for 8 hours straight. It's addictive and a little frustrating, but lots of fun.
Basically a cross between the Sims and Banished, but the good parts. Mostly. I love the way you can edit the settings so you can play without war, since I don't really like combat-oriented games. The control scheme was a little weird at first, but it didn't take long to learn."
"Well, for me it was a somewhat neutral experience overall. It wasn't a really fresh or particularly amazing game. However, it's a good game to spend some idle time on and make a few theories about what's going on in the story (there's definitely clues!), even when the story itself, to me, wasn't all that engaging. Why? Because the human characters themselves just kind of seem to be there as an audience rather than participants, which is far from their roles in this, as the game implies. They're not super fleshed out--heh--but that's to be expected for this demo.
The food characters are fun, though. Can't say I've played a VN where some chibi bits of food apparently play an integral part of the story. If there's something similar to it, don't hesitate to recommend it to me in the comments!

There are indeed some choices that affect the things you see, but eventually, despite the differences, the story will wind back to a familiar point and repeat. Sometimes, some choices you make are ignored later down the line to a point where your past decision should have influenced your current options.

The themes of its horror is also not fully defined, so for now, it relies on scary faces and jumpscares to get ya flinchin'. Again, general visual scares, the type of thing you can find from photoshopped creepypasta (I don't mean this as an insult! This is to illustrate how the scary visuals don't have an identifiable style to them yet).

But, I express all this doubt while keeping in mind this version is an ""appetizer"", so of course, as an incomplete dish, the game is just a taste. A very passable taste.
Despite the game not really impacting me all that much, it does its job to entertain you. So, download it, play it, see for yourself. You've got nothing to lose. It's free.

In conclusion, I'm keeping my eyes peeled. :)"
"I have almost 400 hours in this sim!!!! its simply amazing. I think it is insane how realistic it is, and can't wait for the vulkan update. Also I cant wait to build a rig that can run it in VR. At first I started off with the Cessna 172 and fully learned my way up to the Boeing 747.  I didn't have any intrest in aviation before I started playing this sim. After a little while of playing this I knew that I wanted to go deeper into aviation. I did a few test flights in an actual Cessna 172 and was amazed with the similarities with the real world and the sim. now I have 53 hours in my flight log and am hoping to get my commercial liscense one day.  :)"

"If you happen to have played Irisu Syndrome by the same developer, this one can be described as Irisu meets Touhou, without any scary surprises.

Otherwise, to explain it simply, it's a vertical bullet hell shooting game with an empashis on bullet canceling. You can shoot only one bullet at a time, and while it does clear enemy fire as well as damage them, relying only on that is going to get you killed fast. Instead, you can shoot the colored shapes that appear throughout the level at a steady pace and try to make them bounce against each other: the block will soon explode and destroy anything in its area of effect. Each time the block you shot bumps into another one of the same shape and color, it will cause the second one to explode too, as well as increasing the power and radius of the blast.
That means that rather than squeezing through minuscule openings, you're encouraged to make use of the puzzle-like system to find the perfect moment and angle to hit the blocks and stop the bullets before they even reach you at all. This easy to understand core mechanic remains unchanged for the whole game, but never gets boring as you start to master it and find new ways to save yourself from a difficult spot. The two characters play similarly, with their normal shot being the biggest change: Kairi shoots a bullet that travels to the end of the screen and back, while Satsuki has a short range shot with much higer knockback and creates bigger explosions.

Another important difference from other shmups is that this one doesn't have extra lives or power-ups. Instead, you have a health bar, that can be occasionally replenished by picking up health items, and there is [b] no mercy invincibility[/b] at all, so you can't just let yourself hit it to pass a pattern. You do however have the traditional smart bombs for emergency situations.

Bosses work like Touhou, with the added bonus that some of their attacks are optional and come in the forms of ""duels"": if you play well enough, the boss coughs up a little red blob, and picking it up initiates an additional pattern. These create 
great opportunities for high-scorers, while beginners can easily ignore them with no repercussion.

The game has 5 main stages, which do get progressively more challenging but are easier than what you'd find in most ""pure"" STGs, and an extra 6th stage which ramps the difficulty up to eleven. If you're going for completion, be ready to have your patience tested. There is also a survival mode where you can try to endure the enemy assault for as long as you can, and a absurdly difficult ""hard mode"", that is thankfull not required for anything.
Beating the game should take from 2 to 6 hours depending on your skill level and dedication, while clearing it 100% will extend the longevity quite a bit (took me more than 20 hours to manage everything, just to give you an idea, although to be fair I'm not a master player).

Interestingly, despite being a shoot-em-up, a visible amount of care went into the backstory, which you can unlock little by little by collecting the achievements. It's not the main focus of the game, but it's nice to have a sembiance of plot that is not just a complete excuse to shoot things down, and it's a nice rewards for those willing to go the extra mile.

As for the technical side: enemy mobs are pretty much all variations of the same design, sadly, but the character and bosses' portraits are much more detailed and good-looking. The soundtrack is also easy on the ears and goes perfectly with the flow of the game, especially during the later levels.
I didn't encounter any notable bug, and can confirm PS3 and PS4 controllers both work fine.

[b]Summary[/b]:
+ Unique gameplay concept
+ Interesting lore and backstory
+ Good OST
+/-  Challenging.
-  Slightly lazy mobs design and behaviour. Visual effects could also be a bit better.
-  Relatively short if you don't care about completion.
A breath of fresh air in the genre, and a completely unique shoot 'em up that any fan of the genre should be able to enjoy."
"I had a hard time deciding if I should recommend this game or not, then I decided not to. Just remember, just cause a game isn't recommended doesn't mean it isn't good. I do think that is game is alright for what it is, and it has a lot of potential.

Here's some pros and cons-

Pros:
-Cute art style
-Multiple characters to learn about and choose from

Cons:
-Often the art of the girls will look kinda blurry
-The dialogue is too short imo (for example, at lunch when they speak, it goes by way to quickly. I wish there was a lot more dialogue at times)

In my opinion, the story was pretty boring until around the end of the early access. Like I said, it isn't a bad game, and I'm sure it'll be better once it's fully finished. I'll most probably play it again when it's fully done, but it could use some work for now."
"This game could really use a review that isn't worthless, so I'll give it my best shot.  I bought it quite a while ago and have installed, played around and uninstalled multiple times.  I'd say that this game has a lot of love behind it, a lot of potential in front of it, and some medium-sized issues.

The game uses elements familiar to people who have played Dwarf Fortress, Tropico and Dungeon Keeper.  The player, a disembodied, godlike 'floating hand' is responsible for creating and sustaining a village of tiny, cute, fragile little people.  Unlike Dwarf Fortress, this game is fun to interact with and the controls are easy to use.  It is also several degrees of magnitude simpler, with only wood, stone, food, crystals and magical essense to be managed.  You lay down plans for buildings and assign workers to them, and your citizens lug wood and stone this way and that to make it run.  Every once in a while you will want to cast some spells or carry stuff around.

None of this is very innovative, but it is tightly executed and fun.  The problems start when you ask the game what the point of all this is.  Even on the watered-down difficulty level, the player is facing a stacked deck, as the rest of the map will be filled in with monsters, graveyards, and spawning pits as time goes on.  Hordes of monsters will come calling on a regular basis, and they multiply effortlessly.  The player is not given enough time or tools to do anything but turtle up and survive for as long as possible.

This isn't necessarily a bad thing, as even games like Dwarf Fortress are mostly a hopeless race against doom.  However, in that game you are as likely to be destroyed by a crazy mutant titan from the depths as an army from the surface.  You can employ different strategies, take risks, mess around with the environment and make huge mistakes.  You can read a combat log that details how your brave soldiers were torn limb from limb.  It makes losing a more rewarding experience.

This game does not have features like that yet, and it doesn't seem to be heading in that direction.  You are likely to lose when an endless stream of monsters shows up and soaks up all the ammo from your defense towers.  Due to the limited time and strategies available, you will only have a comprehensive defense set up if you followed a fairly strict building pattern - if you dawdled too long building water facilities, then you will have lost too many villagers to dehydration to staff a guardpost.  Perhaps some last-minute flailing and spellcasting will help you, but if so you will face the Blood Moon event where monsters fall out of the sky all over your town.

So in short this is a fun game that is missing some kind of keystone element that makes it more than the sum of its parts.  It's worth noting that there is a 'peaceful' mode where you can just build a village and no monsters will appear, but that will only make it more obvious that the game lacks a certain je ne sais quoi - perhaps you will build a nice square of roads, or play long enough for enough migrants to show up and finally fully staff your buildings.

Development is tearing right along, which is very nice for people like me who have a mixed history with early access games.  I bet my 10 bucks on this one a while ago and I would say that the game has just about earned it on sheer charm and potential."

This game is actually what it is advertised to be.  It has that 80's look and mechanics with 2000's technology backing it.
"It was really enjoyable to play. It is much more interesting than a normal visual novel, since you have to think about what has been said to progress.
I would love to see more of Glare, she is a lovely character."
"I hated to love so much about this game.

So much great stuff, I got really hooked with the duality of the situation as well as the strategical elements. It looked perfect at the start.

With a brilliant story and art, this game didn’t need anything else to be a success… except that someone had the brilliant idea to make the whole game about “beating the clock”.

I know some people are going to say: “So what, I like the challenge.” but some other people, like me, find this kind of game challenge the cheapest and most unsatisfying of them all. Much like jumping platforms.

A game this beautiful deserves to be appreciated, then absorbed while people play with it, not to be rushed through because there’s a clock ticking.

So if you like to fight the clock go forward, but if like me you don’t, stay away because that’s the core of this game’s gameplay."
video game equivalent to revenge porn. 10/10
"The game takes a little getting used to and I wasn't sure what to do at first, but after I got into it the story was pretty interesting. Overall I enjoyed it. It grows on you."
"A solid short crime story wrapped up in nice art style, with a bit of humor to top it off."
even my mom likes this game
How is this game free? It is so much fun.
"I Love this game, but I also think this game should be able to be played with out VR"
"This is basically an upgrade for windows solitaire, but for some reason I find myself going back to it quite alot. I don't know why. I guess its because its a good background activity whilst working/watching/reading/waiting. Plenty of little things additions to basic solitaire like upgrades, challeneges and unlockables. 

I think I'm just trying to justify myself playing a game called 'faerie solitaire' for such a long time.

Out of 10 I'd say it is passably enjoyable.

"The software is good but not great. The only thing is that when you complete your design, there is no option to place a ROOF on top of your house. It looks incomplete without a roof."
"TL;DR: A pretty unique combination of a puzzle game and a roguelike - and done so, so well. Don't expect replayability though, not that you'd need to.

[h1]What does this button do?[/h1]
I make a living as a software engineer. In my line of work, there are largely two types of people: analytics and intuitives. Analytics read the manual, try to figure everything out before doing anything unnecessary; intuitives just try everything and learn by doing. This game expects you to be the latter - and you'd better figure things out fast...

As an intuitive myself, I gobbled this up. Press all the buttons! ALL the buttons? Wait, this had unintended consequences! How do I do that? Better figure it out! Yes, learning a new interface is a joyous experience. Learning to use your new tricks, to avoid obstacles, all of this can be done, if you can experiment and read occasional manual-pieces found strewn about. Expect your first few tries to end pretty quickly, though - and that's perfectly okay. The adrenaline rush is great.

[h1]Alright, we got things moving...[/h1]
So once you figure out the basic controls, new challenges and twists come around. I'm not going to spoil anything; instead, I'll mention that every time you die, the world is randomised, like it would in a roguelike. There are of course certain constants, and I'll just leave it at that - but in general, you still have to navigate the world and search for point of interest like you did before, so you can't really ""learn"" your way to the end. 

That's not really saying much, though. Because once you get the hang of controls, gain a true understanding of how to pilot the Nauticrawl, things get rather easy. And you can do it again at any time. As such, the game isn't very replayable, unless you enjoy the core gameplay loop and actually piloting the crawler - which, I admit, is pretty fun! You probably won't find any deep secrets, it's mostly hints and lore, so there is arguably little point to do so, but pressing all those levers like an expert is pretty exhilarating. 

[h1]Short end of the stick[/h1]
So the game is not very replayable, and quite short. I beat it after 6 hours, which I actually feel was pretty long, because I messed up at the very end once. But it's a good thing. It could overstay its welcome, but instead it gives just about enough of itself to keep everything sweet. If you're looking for paying 5€ for a game that will last you for 100 hours, go play Terraria or ADOM or something instead. This is an unique, but finite experience. And that's very much alright with me. No molecule of boredom in my bloodstream after beating this!

Another noticeable flaw is that the game actually gets a little too easy at the end. The beginning is a race against the clock and a ploethora of new discoveries, while the last puzzles are almost completely ""press this button lol"". At least that's how it felt to me. But I don't hate the game for it. Not everything has to be hard, and it was still satisfying to solve.

[h1]In the end...[/h1]
...the game is great. I loved it, and I can't recommend it enough. Also, in the modern world where the ubiquity of English language of the internet means the games from the Anglosphere get a natural visibility boost, I feel like games from elsewhere should be celebrated. This game is made by a fellow European brother - an Italian - and yes, a single guy! Well, mostly. Some of the art has been done by someone else, and music is made by David Orr of SONNY fame (remember Newgrounds? Heh). 

So go ahead, try it! You'll know if you like it in 30 minutes. I'd say check it, and refund it if its meh."
"I'm playing the game with a friend.

We build our bases.

He begins researching armor for his robots.

I research radar.

He boasts about how he will destroy me with his newly researched quantum lasers.

I quietly upgrade my radar station's scanners.

He laughs in my face as his laser-armed tanks begin amassing themselves into a mighty army. 

I only have a handful of weak robots armed with assault rifles.

He asks me if I have any last words before he starts his march on my headquarters.

As the final step in my research tree completes, i say: ""Nothing really, except IMMA FIRIN MAH LAZER, BEEEATCH""

A tremendous beam of searing energy erupts from the sky, vaporising his entire army within seconds.

I send in my weak robots, who infiltrate his base and kill him.

10/10 would research radar again."
I wish they made more of these games.
"A fun and suspenseful death game story that kept me hooked until the end. Interesting characters with good dialogue, and absolutely fantastic presentation (especially for an indie VN). The flowchart system can be a little clunky, particularly given the fact that you can't skip already played deduction rooms.

My main problem is the ending (no spoilers). Frankly, I was confused by about half of the reveals that popped up at the end. If you haven't played the previous game, Head AS Code, you'll be even more confused than I was. This isn't simply an issue of reading comprehension either; the ending is truly incomprehensible at some points. Despite my investment in the story and my enthusiasm toward solving the mysteries, I could only give a very general, hole-filled outline of what actually happened if someone asked me to recount the ending.

I'm not sure how much of this confusion was intended. Clearly, some mysteries are meant to go unanswered until the final game in the trilogy. But a lot just seems poorly explained. While I can respect the writer not wanting to insult the reader's intelligence by over-explaining, there's a point where it goes too far in the opposite direction and it feels like the story is telling me I SHOULD be following along despite having lost for most of the true route.

Regardless, my disappointment with the ending didn't sour the entire experience for me. I had a lot of fun for a good majority of the game, and I don't regret my time spent with it."
"FNAF Is scary again!

I've fallen out quite a bit from the FNAF games after FNAF Sister Location, but this game peeked my interest back into the series a ton. Scott and Steelwool Studios did a fantastic job on this, and I hope we can expect to see more things similar to this in the future."
An exciting first chapter of a brand new world for point and click detectives. Marcella Moon: Secret on the Hill is has a well told story and beautiful soundtrack. The game takes you to Ireland to investigate a missing person in a town with a history of fairy kidnappings. It doesn't take long to realize not everyone is being upfront about what is happening in this sleepy little town.
"A very good game simillar to Men Of War.  I personally like the controlls that let you have the abillity to drive a truck or tank your squad is in.  The controlls also let you shoot/walk your man in a squad to a loctation, basically like a 3rd person shooter.  I really love the action in the game.  Great thing to play if your into RTS, stragety, and combat sims.  This game is a classic, and everything fit in like a puzzle.

9/10"
"One of the most intricate JRPGS of our time. A gripping story that takes you on an emotional journey the likes of which rival games such as The Last of Us. The character developments and dynamics are beautifully crafted and it helps to immerse yourself in this deep and complex world. Speaking of which the world is so dynamic and alive. It really feels like you are Putt Putt facing a harrowing hero's quest to save the zoo. Every choice matters is not a statement I give lightly, but I believe Putt Putt deserves it in full. Putt Putt is the dictionary definition of perfection and all games wish they were as magnificently crafted as this. 
The graphics are as impressive as the narrative. When I turned on RTX the world came alive. It felt more real than the real life I resided in. Every puddle, every surface was so detailed you could honestly show someone a screenshot of the game and they'd think it was just real life.
This is a game for gamers. For the people who love a gripping story, deep narratives, Marxist subtexts, and a downright analytical perspective on modern zoo keeping.
So what are you waiting for. Get this game and it will change your life forever."
"7 Years. 
It is officially 7 years to the day that this game has been out on Steam. 

7 years and it's still in Early Access. It's still in Alpha. That's right. ALPHA. The most recent update was titled ""Alpha 19.3 B6 Experimental"" This game has seen 2 presidents and is about to see a third. This game has graduated high school and almost has a bachelors degree. 

It sounds like I'm gearing up to smash on this game but I'm not. I've spent over 80 hours in it and I've enjoyed my time. However, the fact that it has sold so many and is so highly rated yet is still considered Early Access Alpha is beyond me. Updates are still churning in. The 19.3 B6 update? Available to opt in as of yesterday. 

Devs, it's time to poo or get off the pot. You're making a mockery of what a game in Early Access means. As buggy as it is, Cyberpunk 2077 released fully before you did. We're up to the Playstation 5. Your game is good but you can't keep the training wheels on forever. It's never going to be perfect. Nothing is."
"Now that I've given this game a full go through, let me give you guys a rundown on it.

It's a retro inspired, slightly more archaic R-Type, where you control a pilot in a ship with customizable weapons, be it support drones, a large force-like probe that assists in shooting stuff (which can be controlled remotely away from your ship) and various support missiles. The game makes no effort to impede your creativity, as you can choose so many different options in many different ways. Level-wise, there's a good variety to choose from, and the map you start out with can be imposing. Expect some repetition as the levels start out easy, and then get much harder. By the end of this game, you'll be feeling like you're on the hardest difficulty setting of Touhou. Overall, the journey through the game was something I'd consider unique and worth the time I put in. 

With that said, there are issues. To level up your ship and weapons, you need currency called zogs, which you can find in levels. However, they're limited in number and you can't grind for them. Once you beat a level, you gotta hope you had a good haul going through it. Eventually you will have to choose some weapons and stick with them when you upgrade them. With that said, there's also a bug that sometimes prevents players from seeing the ending of the game despite conquering the galaxy. I just wanna bring that up for those unaware. Why do I still recommend the game despite such issues? Because it hit the mark for this genre of shooter so close. And the dev is friendly enough, so i give it a pass. But if he fixes it in the future, that would be even better, and I'll alter my review to reflect that should he do that."

"While you can use a macro to click you'll have to aim at the letters for the achievements to be taken in account. The 5000th achievement appears after the New Game + which weirdly looked like all pixel on my screen no matter restarting and other things I tried to fix the problem. I vote no for the pixel look, it made me feel like the difficulty was to guess what was written.
Only buy it if you feels like clicking 10 000 times on letters, bombs and lightnings.. Getting it free is another option *winks at icaio*"

"[h1][b][i]Nearwood[/i] is an endearing HOPA with lush visuals that draws you into its imaginary world.[/b][/h1]

[i]Jane Lockwood has returned to her old familial home under a mysterious summons to finally resolve the truth of her parents disappearance. Transported to a magical world she  must outwit an ancient force to return time to its normal passage.[/i]

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1481429140

[h1]Narrative[/h1]
[i]Nearwood[/i] is fairly simple in scope. Unlike similar tales of crossing into fantasy lands, Jane is limited in her exploration and never quite faces the dire situations that a certain Jane, Peter, Edmund and Lucy face for instance. The primary issue here is not the techniques of storytelling within the game but a lack of tension and suspense. Jane has already been living as an orphan for many years and despite her desire to help the adorably cute inhabitants of the land, she risks nothing. She can still return to the normal world, her parents have already been lost and she is already independent. This lack of tension leads to one tepid scenario after the other.

Characterization is limited and marked primarily through the artistic design of the sprites. Many of the roles here are stereotypical… and only The Evil itself and Fey (your gnomish assistant) transcend this and relegate more to archetypal characteristics. 

The other concern around the characterization here is the complete helplessness of the characters. They are utterly incompetent and unable to help themselves. Request after request you resolve for them, and I personally became frustrated at their seeming lack of agency. Other games resolved this dilemma by showing the character busy with another task whilst you assist them with it but here they are completely idle. I found myself feeling resentful when each quest was resolved and they offered another even though pursuing their silly errands was, ultimately what drove the plot forward. 
So this was an issue as well, what should have been side-quests were actually the main quest, or linked to a resolution in the main quest. Whilst doing this can create more cohesion in a game and provide more motivation to complete side quests, here I felt forced into completing aimless errands that didn’t really convey the primary story. It’s storytelling at its most frustrating.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
[i]Nearwood[/i] is a tight and solid experience in the gameplay department. It works incredibly well with the mouse, and despite some puzzles and minigames being clearly designed for a touchscreen they still worked well with the PC control scheme. 

While playing HoS the mouse is responsive and even if I slightly misclicked near an object it would still note it as selected. Whilst this does make gameplay easier it is far better than the frustration of clicking an object only to not have it register. 
Movement through the world is smooth and the scenes transition quickly whether you switch from an exploration area to area or switch to a puzzle or HOS. 

The world itself slowly expands as you advance through the story, and gated areas provide a compelling reason to figure out how to bypass them to see the next area. Another refreshing change was the fact that once unlocked; all areas can be returned to. This helped make the world feel more expansive than if they had limited areas of exploration at various points of the game. A map is available to return to areas, and whilst the game does have some backtracking, it never felt too repetitive and was definitely alleviated by the gorgeous scenery. 

The collectible items here are Snoop-sees, strange Totoro like creatures that inhabit the world in a productive and mischievous way. What I enjoyed about them as rather than merely unlocking an achievement (which this game doesn’t have) They unlock a small additional fairytale like story in a book. This actual reward of content within the game itself that enhanced the lore was a welcome inclusion.

[h1]Graphics[/h1]
Visual are were [i]Nearwood[/i] excels. They are lush and effervescent, teeming with a pastel colour palette that is as soothing as the casual gameplay. 

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1480802005

The environmental backdrops convey an idea of distance, hinting at future areas to discover. The openness of the horizons in many scenes give an idea of expansiveness, that there is more to explore, which is one of the finest reasons to play a fantasy game… simply the curiosity of exploring the new and unknown territories that await. Environments do vary from mushroom filled caverns to floating islands the game runs through a gamut of areas to explore. 

The creature designs are excellent as well. Bizarre and strange conglomerations of beasts; they are alleviated from scariness with their childish proportions and enlarged eyes. Their appeal lies in their cuteness. And this lack of threat they embody assists the idea of a temperate and serene environment distorted and twisted by the malevolent evil.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1481340155

[h1]Sound and Music[/h1]
Soft orchestral arrangements that are melodic and dreamlike accompany your exploration of the game. Woodwinds provide the base accompanied by the shinier higher tones of harps or xylophones that add a magical expression to the earthen tones. There’s a traditional folk music appeal that enhances the quaintness of the world. The songs are short though, weighing in at about 1:30 each which can become repetitive, however the game is quick enough that it shouln’t be too much of an irritation.

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
Nearwood is an endearing fairytale world. It showcases the inventiveness and creativity that makes fantasy such an appealing genre. Despite being simplistic in execution, its high production values make it a charming experience that is well worth a purchase if you enjoy the fantasy genre or HOPA games.

"Because Faker plays it.

Enough said"
"For the first 3 minutes, I thought this game was AWFUL.  Weird controls, simple graphics . . . Then I stuck with it, reached about 25 more minutes, re-did the tutorial, and now I can't stop playing it!  It's addictive!

My advice, do the tutorial, actually read the tutorial notes because the interface is a bit clumsy and does take a bit of time to learn how the controls work.

It's a steal at this price.

Still playing months later. May be my favorite game of all time. Developers continually make it better. So much game in such a simple, and cheap, package,"
"Hard to really judge this app, since it is required for the boardgame, so I'll review in relation to that. The app works really well, automates a lot of stuff and allows cool things to happen (like skill checks with hidden values). Keeps information hidden from the players so it really does feel like you are exploring Middle Earth. 

One thing I dislike is an undo button or back button. You can review all the game text in the party menu but if you accidentally click the wrong button, it's permanent. 

Some of the other reviews here are odd - giving this a thumbs down because they don't own the boardgame. Another review said you need to go into the app to set everything up in the app to reflect the game. That's not true either. The app keeps track of what enemies are on the board and their health, but not where they are. That's what the board is for. The app also provides symbols for each monster type, so you can tell the difference between two groups of Goblin Scouts on the board (you use a physical banner with the symbol on it). 

Another review said this was for DM's who are lazy. Not true either.  There is no DM. The app essentially is the DM for the boardgame. 

If you bought the boardgame, you'll need this.  If you don't own the boardgame, don't bother downloading - this isn't a game."

"World's Dawn is similar to Stardew Valley in that you have just inherited a farm house in a tiny rural village and you can grow crops, fish, mine, cook, and make friends with all the villagers; however, World's Dawn has much more focus on your relationships with the villagers than on the farming and other stuff (especially the mining, that is tiny compared to how Stardew does it). If you really liked the farming/mining/fishing in Stardew but not so much the relationships stuff, then this is probably not the game for you. If you wanted more out of the relationships in Stardew and don't need the farming etc as much, then World's Dawn is probably worth a try."

 Achievement hunters will be disappointed at 2 achievements for starting and ending game. Linear story start to finish no navigation or choices needed. Just sit back till it ends. Visuals are on expected polished anime standards. Some dialogues come across as funny when Liya or Mori rag Yan in sarcasm. Or when they team up to make fun of him. However it does look funny when Yan talks of a full canteen and picture shows a nearly empty one. As long as a game ends with a smile on your face, its OK I suppose. Visual Novels and love stories are not really everyone's cup of tea. But no loss really at such a cheap rate and bonus Trading cards in deal. The novel may possible bore some. You need to click the screen to go from dialogue to dialogue as and when scenario changes to progress in the simple still anime movie. That is a some amount of dialogue to read and click though. Achievement hunters may want to use an auto clicker to end it in 30 minutes to finish to unlock the 2 achievements."
"To be honest, Green Hell is very similar in many ways to Forest. But also is very different in details.
If you like real survival games - take a look at this one. Game takes place in Amazonian rainforest. Because of that, everything around will try to kill or harm you.
You will have to eat, drink and sleep. But it is not so easy to get right food and clean water. You will have to find specific types of food to replenish fats, carbohydrates, proteins.
Story is interesting and pretty much dramatic at times, and just as in Forest, you find some info and things that can unlock new areas for progressing through the story.
Also in Green Hell you have crafting and building, but to be honest, I think that building is a missed opportunity. Because there is no point of building anything except beds to save and sleep. Here it is hard to find and produce specific resources. In Forest building was a big part of gameplay that could give you hours of enjoyment. But not here. There are specific places that can be used for building structures, but they are rare. Also in some areas where you need specific item to climb up - you can't build a.. ladder, let's say - no, you can't build even a bed. I know that it is a minor and not rare thing to restrict player from breaking a game like that, but looks a bit lame.
Got through all the story together with my wife in co-op, it was a fun experience, but not as great as in Forest.
So if you like survival games, story-driven, with some bits of hardcore gameplay - buy Green Hell, it is really good.
If you are more into building bases, fights with different kinds of enemies, more player-friendly experiences, I'd say look at Forest or some other games of similar kind."

"Worth 5 dollars? sure. It's short, cute and not too difficult. I'd say it's perfect for a kid. and not your inner child..an acctual child. The 'puzzles' are really simplistic and strait forward with 5 different adorible robots that do very strait forward things and nothing but those things. In my opinion the end was poorly done based on the previous pace of the game, they go from being obvious to being abstract right at the end which confused me and caused me to take longer at the end. My real issue with this game is I worked till the end beat it..then the game automatically fastforwarded through all of the end dialog so I got none of the end story. If you have a child you want to get out of your hair for a while with something minimally thought provoking but not brainless, then I'd get them this. However if you yourself are looking for something there are better things out there for 5 dollars or for free. (I picked it up in the humble bundle so I can't complain too much.)"
"I bought this game for my kids (4 + 7) because a friend recommended it to me. My kids don't have any active video game experience so far. They were absolutely gleeming when they realised that they can play with their favorite heroes. 
However, after one hour of gaming they already got bored out by the ever repeatetive levels and challenges. 
There's actually not much to achieve (at least not in the first five levels) and even my 4 year old girl was irritated over the fact that she was very limited in her actions.
The levels are not very lovingly designed and offer little interesting. After only two levels, my big one has had enough of the fact that she has to do everything over and over again with each of the appearing heroes.

My conclusion: This game is absolutely not worth 30,- EUR. 
5~10,- EUR would be fine. But I would expect a lot than copy and paste game.

Also: The game is advertised to be available in 8 languages. BUT you cannot switch languages manually! If you happen to have an english system you are in-game bound to the system language (english) even though your kids don't speak english. So the supposedly available 8 languages are actually misleading."
"This just made me happy. With the 3rd song, they really made it feel like you're part of an anime music video. Even if all you do is sit around for the whole thing, the characters interact with you to a surprising degree. Helped in part by the fact that your character has an actual body, and the girls make you hold things, show you pictures on their phones, and more.

While none of these songs are games, just experiences, if you go into knowing what you are getting, I would say it's definitely worth it."
"Okay so I didn't realize this was #4 in the series. Small detail. Whatever. Anyway, I really enjoyed this game and spent a lot of time on the puzzles because I genuinely liked them. Very much looking forward to playing #5 next!"
Faithful adaptation of the original board game.  This was a favorite among my gaming groups before the cataclysm and it's been nice to have it available for online play while we wait for the world to remember how to stop destroying itself.
"As an avid lover of minesweeper, the idea of this game jumped out at me. The idea itself is actually quite brilliant. Take the random losses out of standard minesweeper by adding fun and engaging mechanics, including a health bar. From start to finish this game was very hard to enjoy. The beginning tutorial is pretty minimal (which I don't mind), however all the random effects in this game are really hard to keep up with as a new player. It's nice that there's a built in dictionary for all the effects and terms that are in the game, but it throws everything at you immediately and you constantly have to stop and read the info. Games without tutorials are successful when they teach/force the player to learn mechanics as they progress. This is just ""Hey here's how to play minesweeper"" followed by throwing you into a game with items that have effects such as: orbs, electric, cursed, sanctified, ethereal (to name just a few). Its a lot to keep up with right away.

After getting through the first few quests of the game and unlocking hard/beyond mode, the lack of tutorial is further shown to be an issue. The only reason I knew how heirlooms work is because I had heard and seen them on the subreddit prior to reaching that point of the game. Had I not known about it I would be 100% clueless as to how they work, how to get artifacts, etc. This is unfortunately not the biggest flaw of the game.

As I mentioned earlier, the idea of having minesweeper feel more fair and less random is a great idea and having a game built around allowing mistakes, but not making every level solvable is good. The only problem here is that the game fails to do so. Each quest has around (if not exactly, I haven't been bothered to keep track) 10 stages per quest. In my experience at least half of these require a guess or more. With the random loot in this game you could easily get nothing to deal with this. Taking say 5 50/50 guess into account, that's a 1 in 32 chance you get them all right, or ~3% chance to succeed all of them. This could be mitigated by the health, however hard mode gives you 3 hp, which can easily be taken out in one shot after the third stage.

With just the basic idea of having to guess constantly, it already sounds unfair. Now lets talk about stage modifiers. Stage modifiers add some negative or positive effect. My personal favourites are fake, cryptic and elemental. Fake gives 3 random cells the wrong value. Some cells you can tell which one is wrong, but the majority of the time you can't. In stages with 400 plus cells, it's borderline impossible to check every cell for correctness. During later stages not being able to recognise incorrect cells can lead to clicking a monster (the mines of demoncrawl) and kill you on the spot.

Cryptic obscures cells of value 4 or greater. Most often they are 4's so it can be easy to deal with in some cases, but of you have multiple obscured cells next to each other you have to guess. This happens almost every time this stage mod appears.

Lastly we have elemental. The cells can contain burning, electric or frozen. I am going to ignore electric for the sake of this review as it has no real negative consequence here. Burning cells that appear as a result of a stage mod are visible when the cell is unopened and are guaranteed to not have a monster. The issue? Clicking on them loses you 1hp. In a standard stage this would be fine, however you also have to deal with frozen cells. Frozen cells cannot be opened or flagged. They could have a monster, might not. There are ways around this, but not having that extra information can be detrimental for solving a stage. Combine these two and suddenly you have an issue. For a stage to be solved it must have all non monster (excluding frozen) cells opened. You can chord to open burning cells normally, however because you can't flag frozen cells, you can't chord around them either. Forcing you to take damage. For reference, in hard you only have 3 hp. If you are unlucky enough to be forced to open 3 burning cells by hand, you just lose.

Like any rogue-lite, items are completely random. Most other rogue-lites are built in a way that getting really any set of items in a given run is still winnable.In my experience only a handful of items in Demoncrawl are overly useful, while most of the 500+ items are very minimal in use. Yes you can win levels instantly, yes you can quickly compound items to gain extreme levels of power, but the main issue with that is that the game always has that completely random chance of just ending the whole run with one omen from one chest. I do enjoy the runs that have usable items but I've never played more of a reset simulator than this game when it comes to items. The chance of getting omens early (or even immediately depending on your luck) in runs basically just forces you to start over.

I get that certain items can counter stage mods, I know of at least one that outright removes them, but the problem there is that it is 1 item out of hundreds. There's only so many items you can get in a run and so many you can favourite. I'm not complaining about the item count by any means, but there's always a chance that you won't get what you need, lose what you need, or just can't deal with the given situation. Oh I have a ton of cankers now? Well I hope I hit that 1/500 chance to get this one item I need.

As far as masteries go, I think they need a bit of an overhaul/rebalance. I've mentioned this on the subreddit before, but the fact that 99% of people tell others to use one of a couple masteries shows a huge imbalance, Spy being the most popular, and for obvious reasons. The whole point of spy is to reduce the randomness by a little bit in favour of skill, but this doesn't always work (especially when you get cryptic :)). Most, if not all, masteries in the game are completely countered by a stage mod or omen, so there's really no safety there.

There's a lot about this game that I have issues with. Most of it comes from the fact that the mechanics of this game are built around making minesweeper more fair, but in reality this game is built to be a gauntlet of RNG. The devs have added an easy mode that makes all stages solvable and I've seen them mention it in other similar reviews. This game mode does not have game progression. Why should I play your game then? There's no reward for this mode and it completely defeats the point of having items, abilities etc. in your game. I'd say a lot needs to be reworked before I can view this game in a positive light."

"I peridoically come back to this game and love it. I don't know if development is still going at all, but I hope so. I want that multiplayer!"
"It's not a complex, blow-out game or anything, but it's clean and well done, and for being made in a few short days by a 7 year old who only just picked up a coding book 28 years older than herself? Wonderful.

I hope you stick to it and continue to grow, I look forward to seeing what you do."
"I think the story deeply affected me because I live in Turkey. The atmosphere, music and dialogues were very realistic and dramatic. There are millions of Syrian asylum seekers in our country. Life story of all of them are different. Their family is fighting each other. Politics are ruining people's lives! This is a very sad situation. I hope this situation gets better soon. I would like the second game to be paid to support the producer. (hopefully the second part will be in Turkey)."
nice
"Do NOT buy this game! Save game cannot launch after an automatic update. The producer said there would be compensation in terms of character equipment, which is completely inadequate for the loss of players."
"This game is the closest you can get to playing DnD in videogame format. If you like tabletop RPGs and interactive story telling, don't pass this up!"

"Everything about Skullgirls is perfect. The devs clearly spent a lot of time crafting this game to be as polished as humanly possible, and it shows. The art is gorgeous, the soundtrack is amazing, and most importantly, the game is fun. This is the most balanced fighting game I've ever played, and the fact that every character is viable in some way means that there's plently of variety when it comes to teams. The game also goes out of it's way to teach newcomers, with insanely in-depth tutorial and training modes. Whether you're a fighting game veteran or looking for your first pick, Skullgirls is a fantastic game to add to your repertoire."
"I would recommend this game for the following reasons:

1. The graphics are pretty nice. The game hovers around 60 FPS at 1080p. It is vibrant and colorful. The main characters looks great and animates well. Enemy animation, however, isn't as smooth as I would like. I liked the grand scale of some of the levels which are floating in the sky and have you traversing higher up as you progress. You can see parts of the tower floating in the background. They are detailed enough that it creates a cool 3D effect. It's cool to start at the bottom and work your way up only to look all the way down and say, ""hey, I was just there."" Unfortunately, much of the first levels look similar. I haven't seen the later levels yet, though. 

2. The gameplay is fun and pretty unique for PC. It is an adventure game where you play as a princess trying to discover the mysteries of a massive tower. There are six levels and the increase in complexity and scale as you progress. There doesn't seem to be any power-ups or collectables other than crystals that you are required to find in each level. Crystals are gotten from beating enemies and breaking statues. They can be cleverly hidden so finding all the crystals is a challenge. Enemies don't vary much and they're pretty easy to dispatch. The real star of the show is the level layout, puzzles and traps that you must get through. The puzzles are what you'd expect from this type of game (move boxes to jump higher, throw switches to move platforms) but they fit well with the whole massive tower-floating-in-the-sky theme. The traps can pose a bigger challenge and I was supprised to find that I just barely made it out of the first level alive because of all the traps. 

3. The price is right. This isn't a big game, but it's a nice diversion and it's something different than what we are used to on PC. 

4. Trying to 100% each level is a fun achievement. I don't know if it will make a difference in the game or ending, but finding all the crystals is a nice challenge. 

Some other things: this game works with a controller (although I noticed the controls were a little spotty and unresponsive a few times). There's not much music variety in this game and sometimes sound effects are missing, but there is voice acting. The voice acting is what you'd expect from the genre (cute little girl voices). 

I would recommend this game, especially if you are a fan of the genre (Japanese style adventure/action games). It is a budget title but it is very playable and enjoyable at a reasonable price."
"I really enjoyed playing this game with my friends! However, as I reached an unfortunate scene as Jed unloaded his seed into my character's mouth, I reached a conclusion that this game may be for people of the homosexual variety. Still, a great game! Look forward to countless hours with the homies! Good job team!"
"Lacuna is one the finest detective games I've ever played and a fantastic first game for I assume to be a new dev team. Everything about this game is quality, The writing is engaging, the atmosphere is nice, and the game is really reactive. The gameplay is essentially straight up gathering clues and deduction, there are no traditional inventory puzzles or logic puzzles at all. Because of that everything flows really well with the narrative and the game is paced well. I'd say the only flaw is that there's no manual saves so you got to go through the whole game again to see other paths. It's autosave only to discourage you to change your choices, but I admit I just hard closed out of the game like twice after I screwed up something to avoid the game autosaving, so something like permanent chapter checkpoints after you get an ending would be a better way to do it.

Overall this is probably going to be end up being one of my favorite games of the year, its a great adventure game and I highly recommend it."
"Bought a small rock to weight down the 'W' key.
10/10"
"7.5/10. Really good progression of the main conceit of the original story, along with excellent development of a background, larger-than-life character from the original, are hindered by weak ""traditional"" fandisc content.

Flight Diary is a ""fandisc"" for the VN If My Heart Had Wings. For anyone not in the know, a fandisc tends to be fan-servicey (in both non- and sexual contexts) story content for both the main heroines as well as others who didn't have routes in the original VN. As a result, there's really no reason to be interested in this if you haven't played the original. If you have, then read on.

Presentation is basically the same as the original VN. You've got a config window where you can set what seems to be the rendering resolution of the VN (and there are some settings you can't modify that say things like 16K resolution textures, which I'm not sure about). The art is mostly the same as the original, though there are new sprites for new characters, or characters with expanded focus. Most of them are inoffensive; there are a couple I really didn't like for some reason (mainly Kanako's new pose). As far as I can tell there's only one new musical track; I didn't care for it at first, but it kind of grew on me.

Mechanically it's nothing: you select which route you want to take at the beginning from a list, and there are no choices from there. It's effectively the same as most VNs, where you're doing nothing more than picking which girl's route you want to take.

The original VN was the subject of some controversy when it released, due to a poor-to-butchered translation (if you're reading this review before reading the original VN, be sure to use the translation patch), censoring (which is always divisive, but in this case the censuring was more extreme than usual), and the translation company's response to these criticisms--that they were marketing this eroge to ""12-year-old French girls."" In light of this, some scrutiny of this VN with regards to those first two issues is warranted. I'd say it's mostly fine, however: there are a couple of instances where the translation is clearly wrong to anyone who's been reading VNs enough to recognize a few Japanese words (there're a couple lines where a VO says ""American"" and ""Nihonji"" one after another, but the translation doesn't reflect this at all), but there are no moments where you're reading gibberish like Ageha's route in the original VN. Additionally, the censuring is limited to 18+, or possibly 17+ (going by Newton and the Apple Tree's example) content, where nudity is not shown and sex is never implied (and obviously not shown), but dialog that mentions ""boobs"" is [b]not[/b] censured like the original. I see no problem with sex and nudity not being shown; I don't need this content, and it was never meaningful in the original VN. The lengths they go to avoid any implication of it, however, are pretty ridiculous: characters get in the shower wearing bathing suits, girls sit in the bathtub wearing a towel over their body, at one point a scene with Aoi and a girl (in a public location) fades to black and later on he ""breaks out in a cold sweat"" remembering what he did in a public place - ""kissing.""

Like most fandiscs, this includes short content with heroines new and old; however, it also includes a prologue and an epilogue to the original VN. The former is mostly poor, while the latter is excellent. I'll briefly critique each one [b]in the order I think they should be played[/b].

Kotori - weak. The idea behind it is nice, but it doesn't advance any plot elements or develop her character. Also extremely short.

Asa & Yoru - very weak. No meaningful story content at all. This feels like nothing more than an excuse for more threesome content, rendered hilarious by the censuring (Aoi spends five minutes kissing each one on the ears and lips to the point that you get a moan and the screen blinking white in an obvious they-just-orgasmed moment, which results in them saying ""I want to keep kissing you forever, Aoi-senpai""). Also ridiculously short.

Kanako - weak. Goes into a fair bit more detail that the previous two, as it's a ""newly romancable"" character, but there's no conflict to make anything feel meaningful, or any real development of the interesting side of her character only generally hinted at in the original.

Hotaru - slightly weak. Like Kanako's it does go into more detail, but also like hers there's no real conflict either. She [i]does[/i] show some growth through the story, but it feels somewhat arbitrary in its impetus. It also results in a pretty weird ending that seems to come from left field.

Prologue (Isuka) - very good! This is technically the prologue of the original VN, but it's really Isuka's route (not in the past, but the present). It's longer than any of the previous stories, and goes pretty deep into Isuka's motivations from the beginning of the soaring club's formation, as well as how she responds in the present day to the club's current incarnation and her role in everything (as the impetus for pretty much everything). Has meaningful conflict and accessible themes. Spoiler for the original VN, but in that one Tatsuya liked her, and that relationship blossoms here in amusing and touching ways. This is told from the perspective of Amane's route in the original VN, which means there are a couple obviously censured ""heavy kissing"" scenes with her (and Aoi).

Epilogue (Kotori / Soaring Club) - fantastic! I mentioned before that there were new characters; this is where they appear--two new members of the Soaring Club. The focus here is on the ""passing of the torch"" and all that entails, with respect to both the club and the older members (Aoi, Kotori, Ageha) who are soon graduating. This story has the biggest focus on the glider itself, and I'll be honest: like the original VN, I found this the least interesting side of the story. But everywhere else it expands in excellent ways. There's the personal conflict that the characters (mostly Kotori and Aoi) undergo as it relates to their impending graduation from high school, as well as the growth of the younger club members to fill their shoes. There's also the club's status, which expands in interesting ways I won't really detail here, but which totally and completely resolve a couple of the biggest criticisms I had for the original VN. And in the end it provides a definite sense of closure to the story and all of the involved characters. It's honestly really great.

So what we have here is once again a mixed bag. Some pretty high highs for anyone invested in the original VN (which are in some ways [i]better[/i] than the original), as well as some in-my-opinion uninteresting fanservice content. Is it worth it on the quality of the good content alone? I think so.

There's talk of Akari's route being added as a DLC, but I don't imagine that'll be anything that different from Kanako's or Hotaru's in design, apart from blue-balling poor Ma-bou."

[h1]«Review(En):»[/h1]
This is not a puzzle, but a magnificent arcade game with cute biped robots. You move the legs of the robot one step at a time, climb up platforms and complete tasks. You move the legs of the robot with the mouse buttons or sticks of the gamepad.
If you play together, the difficulty increases, but the game becomes more fun, unpredictable and exciting.
You need a mouse and a controller or a pair of controllers for a local co-op. The keyboard is not used in the game.
The devs recommend playing with a gamepad (the game says so in the splash intro screen), but to playing is much more convenient and easier if you use a mouse.
You cannot use two mice in the game. The game will ask you to connect the controller as an addition to the mouse, even if having two mice connected. The only way to play with two mice is in an online co-op!
When you play together online co-op, the progress of coins, stars and open levels is saved only at the host! This is what the developer intended (the second player helps the host in his progress).
+ Excellent co-op mode for two players (online and local with on common screen without split screen).
+ There is a single mode.
+ Cute robots.
+ Beautiful graphics.
+ Great music and sounds.
+ High-quality mechanics, physics, design and gameplay.
+ The game is suitable for adults and children.

Это не головоломка, а великолепная аркада с милыми двуногими роботами. Мы по очереди передвигаем ноги робота, чтобы преодолеть препятствия, карабкаться по платформам и выполнять задания. Ноги робота двигаем кнопками мышки или стиками геймпада.
Если играете вдвоем, то сложность увеличивается, но игра становится более веселой, непредсказуемой и увлекательной.
Для локального кооператива вам понадобится мышь и контроллер или пара контроллеров. Клавиатура в игре не используется. Хоть в игре пишут, что предпочтительнее играть на геймпаде, но на мышке играть гораздо удобнее и проще. Жаль, но использовать две мышки в игре нельзя. Игра попросит вас подключить контроллер в качестве дополнения к мышке, даже если будет подключено две. Единственный способ играть с двумя мышками - это в онлайн-кооперативе!
В онлайн-кооперативе прогресс монет, звезд и открытых уровней сохраняется только у хоста! Так задумано разработчиком (второй игрок помогает хозяину в его прогрессе).
+ Великолепный кооперативный режим для двоих (онлайн и локальный с общим экраном без разделения).
+ Есть одиночное прохождение.
+ Симпатичные роботы.
+ Красивая графика.
+ Отличная музыка и звуки.
+ Качественная механика, физика, дизайн и геймплей.
+ Игра подходит взрослым и детям.

"If you had played hello lady you know how good this game is. Its a masterpiece visual novel with salutation to William Shakespeare ""Hamlet"", this made me interested in Shakespeare work. Unlike other visual novel, hello lady uses a unique and beautiful tone in narrating the story, which make you feel like watching a drama. New division is the FD to the main game, it contains Mitori route which I sure everyone would have wanted so badly. I highly recommended this game! I love Saku and Mitori!"
"Wow, the time for my first review has finally come and I'm quite happy that it's gonna be for this game.
So, this game's about: Journey, ""friendship"" (only true friendships are gonna last if you play this game in coop), and the bounds between two people that, even though sometimes can seem quite restricting, if powerful enough can overcome even the hardest of the obstacles, achieving a sense of retribuition that I have rarely seen in other games before.

Let's start by saying that if you really want to enjoy the game you'll have to find a ""couch-mate"" and fortunately I had my little sister.

The game is obviously not perfect; It has his faults but it's overall a very solid game that can give you a good time.

pros:
+ The art style: It is amazing! I like it a lot, the minimalistic pixel art reminds me ""Superbrothers""!
+ gameplay: The gameplay has a very unic concept. The bound between two people has never been really exploited like it has been here! It can obviously be  improved but it's overall nicely done!
+ Music/sound effects: All the sounds and the music blend very well with the style of the game giving to the experience a nice onirical feel.
+ Bosses: the design of the bosses is one of the best i?ve ever seen! Eachone is unique and the difficulty is well calibrated.

cons:
- Difficulty: I like difficult games and the tougher the better but, I understand that it can be tedius replaying a room over and over. The sense of accomplishment after beating it though! [spoiler] (but really, fuck the fire  temple) [/spoiler]
- approach: Approaching it for the first time could result confusing and nobody really holds your hand. Explore your sorrounding and die to live again.. each time you'll be wiser.
- Single player: I find that playing this game alone is sightly more difficult and sightly less rewarding.. So go to find yourself a mate!

Overall it's a solid game with a hidden lore, full of symbolism, great graphic and a great gameplay concept that are greatly put together..
..and remember travelers of the maze: nobody is watching after you, you only have eachother and the game likes to change the rules often, so think wisely every move you chose to make and learn how to overcome even the simpler of the foes."
"I lost my written review because I played this offline bloody Steam doens't recognize it... Damn...

Anyway, this is a great game and a great series. Gail and Sabina are an awesome pair and with each new Episode being more elaborate than the other I can't wait for the final Episode of the series. I sincerely wish that the end of Space Pilgrim will not sound the end of the adventures of Gail and Sabina, because they definitely deserve to be in the spotlight for much, much longer."
"Retro-shooter with a classic view in which we need to destroy the enemies using or bypassing various obstacles. According to the story, we will play for a beautiful girl in a red dress, which goes in search of his brother, who was kidnapped by radioactive gnomes in the sewers. All we need to do is to use the environment skillfully, because our heroine is able to break barrels and crates in search of various supplies and shoot a variety of gnomes by shooting through the iron bars.
The game boasts its pixel style, colorful cut-scenes and cool 8-bit sound environment."
"This game is good arcade fun, with lots of polished and exciting elements.

PROS
- collisions work well
- fun weapons
- challenging, exciting, and engages my attention
CONS
- head-directed movement is awkward but only at first

There is a thing that happens when you blow up an enemy and yourself it says ""GOOD!"" With a message in your face labelled ""suicide"""
"Things that are good

1. Really complitated
2. Gets you to think
3. Its creative
4. I like puzzel games
5. Who cares about graphics, no one
6. Free to Play

Things that are bad

1. ...well you rage a lot

Good Luck"
"I really enjoy the game, I hope to see a lot added to it in the future; mostly things like taking way the tutorial thing at the start because I hate redoing that everytime even though its the same start everytime. There is also no way to know what makes what so you spend a lot of time just dying and then you forget what you need to make the next thing. I would also like to be able to see my food in a different place or at least be able to move the items around to manage it better, a lot of the time you will just starve just from not paying attention. 
OVERALL I do like this game and recommend it because its not expensive, its fun and I HOPE to see more added it would make the game so much more fun!"
"I was mildly salty about how the game ended. The only thing that kept me playing was the storyline, yet it felt unfinished. I guess that's just how life works. Overall it's a good game to spend some time on.

[spoiler] Don't you just hate when the dog drive silently? [/spoiler]"

"[b]Zenge is a relaxing little puzzle game with simple mechanics, serene gameplay and a wonderful soundtrack and artwork to accompany it.[/b]

Though i’m not usually a puzzle kinda guy I’ve been delving into the genre a bit more recently and with around 300 positive reviews I felt Zenge was a game I had to try since I’d bought it in a bundle. It truly is a game worthy of every thumbs up it’s been given.

[b]General Gameplay[/b]
Zenge focuses on simple puzzles that remind me of something similar to a jigsaw puzzle. You’ll have various pieces/shapes which must be moved to the place they fit in correctly. You start by being able to slide pieces around, though pieces cannot pass through others so you’ll have to move them in a specific order. After the first few levels you’ll starting finding new ways to manipulate your pieces such as rotating, teleporting, connecting shapes to make larger ones, flipping, and altering the sizes.
The puzzles are relatively easy and even the ones that look a little difficult at first can be solved by just taking your time and looking around. There is no way to fail the level, no timer, no move limit and no score. Everything about Zenge seems to be designed to be relaxing, not mind-breaking.
After each level you are ‘awarded’ with a wonderful piece of art which follows the journey of Eon. Although there is no dialogue in the game every image tells a story in it’s own way.
The game is short (my playtime is not accurate due to card drops) with around 70 levels taking 1 hour to complete, maybe two if you take things slow so the content is more than great for the price and will keep you busy for a little while.

[b]Graphics & Sound[/b]
The graphics may seem simple but they are actually rather beautiful whilst you play and the artwork when you complete each level is well worth the $1 in itself. Despite never really having a story explained to you seeing the pictures of Eon as the travels feels like a story in some form.
The soundtrack is something that I personally love and immediately went to buy when I finished the game but found out that it’s actually free to download on Soundcloud which is awesome. The music is soft and once again makes you feel completely relaxed and compliments the game perfectly.

[b]Pros[/b]
--- Fantastic artwork.
--- Clever gameplay mechanics.
--- Wonderfully relaxing soundtrack.
--- Simple puzzles.
--- 70 levels to complete.
--- Free soundtrack available to download.

[b]Cons[/b]
--- Only one achievement.
--- New methods of manipulation are not explained though they are easy to pick up.

[b]Summary[/b]
Overall Zenge is an amazing game and though it is short it’s really worth it’s price and more. Anyone who is looking for a simple puzzler with beautiful artwork and no way to fail should look no further as Zenge will fulfill all your needs."
"What an absolutely amazing RTS

If you like Warcraft1-3, AoE, C&C, Rise of Nations, AoM, Supreme Commanders, this is the game you are looking for, bring your friends, AI matches are fun, PvP is great, the campaign has a really cool feature, where you can earn permament loadout units/buildings for your future campaigns, and this is also Co-op with a friend, the multiplayer is smooth with no issues, The game can go from fast-pace to long game wars, with a mix of Orcs, Humans and the modern day factions Renegades and Guardians, this allows for some interesting game play, and is rather balanced, But the ORCS are always the best ;)"
"I think games like this don't come around very often. If you dont get side tracked it is still a good solid 5-6hrs. The gameplay is a lot of fun. The story is VERY good, the developers know how to deliver a lot of backstory with very little text. It won't drawn you with walls of text to read so its really easy to follow up on.

There are no tutorials, only side hints of the mechanics of the game, but that only adds to the fun.

10/10 i would recommend all day, everyday."
"Rusty Lake games, most def, have their own unique style.

Samsara Room is, imo, quite charming.
The story and the game-play was a lovely journey, with its signature quirky visual and introspect perspectives.

At the end of the game I was surprised to discover Samsara Room was released to celebrate Rusty Lake's 5th B'day.
Is it just me, or are they quite young for their game development to be at the level it is?!

I remember playing Rusty Hotel etc. on my mobile 4-5yrs ago, and thought they had been established for ages then.

So yes I am a fan, tho this is the third game of theirs i have played, and really enjoyed the journey Samsara Room took me on."
Been playing it everyday for slightly more than two years. Hard to learn and impossible to leave.
"I believe fully in this adaptation, in that it's visually distinct from what Chekhov could have possibly imagined in both choice of media and actual visual presentation, and that it's masterfully woven together to a point where those distinctions don't negatively affect the experience of  c o n s u m i n g  this story."
"First mobile games imitated real video games, except with terrible microtransactions, and now this video game imitates mobile games, except without terrible microtransactions.  

That's not necessarily a bad thing. I think I just saved myself a lot of future cash by spending $10 on this game."
"Lets take a look at hatfall. I will review the game on a pro/ con style and ending it with my own conclusion about the game.

Pro:
     The game is simple. The premise of the game is just to move left and right to catch one falling hat per level while avoiding falling cars, stop signs, ect. It gets trickier the later levels since the other AI can closely resemble Yatzhee making it an obstical to figure out which is the actual player.

      The jokes. The game is full of funny moments from mini games, failure sound effects, and the level start up. They are bare bones and you will see some multiple times but it doesnt subtract from the joy of seeing them.

       The buyable egos. Buying these egos help make the game easier by making it easier to spot the character in the vast ammount of people in the level. Dont worry you dont need to spend actual cash to make the game easier, you just need to collect hats. They are the currency in the game.

        The unlockable items. For the most part the unlockable items are gained from gift drops given after a specific number of hats were caught. Some items are pretty useless like the glasses making the game a shade of pink or the beard displaying censored curse words. Other items active mini games which adds more enjoyment in the game as well helps score some easy hats.

Con:
       Repetitive. The game is very samey but that isnt bad if you are just playing to just get through the game's somewhat existing story. If your going for all the achievements it is a slug fest of grinding away at hats. A few achievements are such a pain to get and unlocking the last few egos are a nightmare.

Conclusion:
        Its a fun game for the fans of zero punctuation. It is very samey similar to games like bejewled. The idea of what makes the game good is how simple it is. It isnt hard to play it or learn to play it. The jokes that are in the game are pretty good and provided a few laughs here and there. The mini games were a blast to do. The only issue is how grindy the game gets and through that it kills the fun because of doing the same things over and over. I can still reccomend the game, it isnt great but it is a nice fun token and a blast to support yatzhee."
"I confess, I never knew what this game was before I bought it. My friend and I joked around the steam store when we stumbled upon this. At first, it’s title is weird. I mean, I thought it was probably your usual steam bloat. But then, when I look at the screenshots, I was like, “This is basically X-COM but with...anime-ish feature” Since it was priced lower before than Chimera Squad (Dandylion please don’t sue me) and I was in a X-COM maniac mode, I said, “Sure, why not”

Suffice to say that, after playing this from start to the end, this is literally the better X-COM Chimera Squad (XCCS) than X-COM Chimera Squad is.

There’s a lot of things that the developer put in this game with a lot of depth, and that is the greatest thing about Troubleshooter. The game is so, so deep. It’s not like X-COM where your strength starts from basic to laser to plasma or psionics (or advanced units like MECS or Templar/Skirmisher/Reaper, but let’s put that away). There’s buildcrafting. You see, in this game, the character strengths are defined by masteries that you can put. Think of it like mods or traits. The best part? There’s a lot of masteries, and I mean, over 200-ish masteries. But not just that. Combining certain masteries will give you a mastery set, which means even more possibilities! You want your tank to be a fireball slinger instead of punchy punchy? Sure. Want your healer to be a debuffer? Why not. Or you want to make your own templar from WOTC, complete with the OP of the Reaper and Parry trait? Why the hell not. The game lives and breathes through its depth, and I can see how meticulous the devs are in this game.

Another thing that it has is its story. XCCS is the first entry from X-COM that tries to focus its narrative and its results are...okay, I guess? Troubleshooter, on the other hand, is different. I always love a story in which its whole cast is interconnected, and boy, there’s a lot of twists in the game. The story really surprises you sometimes that you don’t expect that one particular thing can cause an impact. I like how the story connects as time goes on, and it shows how some plot holes are patched as the game progresses.

But are there bad things about this game? Hmm, I wouldn’t say bad, but more of a “depends” stuff. First, I did say the game has depth. But, reaching that depth would take a long time. It really takes time for things to start gearing up, not just from gameplay but from the plot. I’d say about...25 to 30-ish. It’s okay for some, but some people will be put off by this, especially nowadays when there are a lot of AAA open-world huge stuff yada yada yada. Like I said, it’s not bad, but it’s not good either. It depends.

Another mixed thing is that the start of the game is a bit overwhelming, at least for me. You can be anything in this game, yes, but freedom and effectiveness are two different things. I wouldn’t know how to exactly make my build stronger without some guide. This is a mixed bag, I know, but I would’ve preferred if the game does hand me at least a template for builds or advanced tutorials.

...wow, this is a long review. I think that’s because Troubleshooter has a lot of things to say. It doesn’t copy. It takes notes from XCOM and Fire Emblem in some way. But, it manages to combine all that note and it becomes a thing of its own, and a fantastic game it is. All fans of XCOM, Fire Emblem, SRPG or strategies should really look into this, as this is an underrated gem.

[spoiler] Oh, and I can’t wait for episode 2. I really can’t. [/spoiler]

[spoiler] ...maybe I can if you put some kind of psi-blades for Irene or Albus or Leton. Pretty please? [/spoiler]"
"I recommend this game with all my heart ! :) BUY IT ! YOU HEAR ME ? BUY IT RIGHT NOW !

SCI-Fi RPG, but still very true with the human thinking about this earth.  If u have qustions, ask me ! I will answer at all of them ! FOR REAL, JUST ASK! Add me and ask everything. I can make you understand this amazing game !

I want a second game like this one( A Part 2) or a new one. If the developers can HEAR ME. Make another EPIC GAME for our boring lives and you wouldn`t regret it."
"What an extremely unique and refreshing game!! You play as a firefly (I think?) and you are tasked with rescuing trapped flies from caves. It's a lot more than that though. The levels are full of puzzels that get harder incrementally. Every level is timed so It's all about finding the correct and quickest path to freeing all the flies from the caves. It seems simple but it gets tough pretty quickly. You have to keep your light glowing by reaching light charging stations while also looking for the flies. Which makes for some pretty intense moments. The art is fantastic for this type of game, very cute and detailed. Also, the music is groovy and satisfying. I usually have to mute in-game music but that was not the case in this game. The game is also fully compatible for touch screen systems which is very cool. All in all there is just something very satisfying about this game. Fun progression, cute animations and it just keeps getting better the further into the game you get. I absolutely think this is worth the $5 the developer is charging. If you like puzzle games i'd say snatch this up A.S.A.P.

"
worth the wait after almost more then 2 years!! finally i can't wait to get home and play this game! hopefully i get out of work early :D
"É um excelente jogo no geral para quem gosta de jogos de investigação. Basicamente você resolve um caso de assassinato por cada capítulo, mas  o que mais me chamou a atenção é como os desenvolvedores conseguem prender sua atenção nos casos usando uma história recheada de humor, deixando-a bastante envolvente,
Para mim foi definitivamente uma boa experiência!

Principais pontos positivos:
1-Uma excelente história de detetive.
2-A trilha sonora é espetacular.

Principais pontos negativos:
1- Achei o controle por mouse estranho, então eu recomendaria jogar pelo teclado no lugar. Mas não é nada que impeça o usuário de jogar do começo ao fim usando só o mouse!"
"This game is actually suprisingly fun to play on the PC. While I understand it is a mobile port, the added content, improved graphics, and friendly Dev all make it worth while.

It is a nice casual game to pick up and play for 15-30 min during breaks.

One thing to watch out for though is how often the screen shakes. It shakes a lot to simulate riding a horse. Something I found to counter this shaking is to actually ride a real horse while playing the game. Works great."
"Quest 4 Papa: Reloaded
fast game with modern day graphics with easy controls that moves from location A to B to C and so on,
good amount of action and special effects,

good game.

Personal Suggested Purchase Price: $0.49 Or Less During Sale
"
"A great addition to the Steam's list of games. I played the original titles of this game and they were great too. With the addition of 1080p (or maybe higher) resolutions and the two player version. This is now a much better title.

In my opinion, the game is also safe for kids since it doesn't have violence in it. Yeah, you're swallowing cats and mice but it doesn't actually depict any violence, they just go poof.

I'd recommend this title even if it didn't have a discount. It's a simple game and has a simple soundtrack and simple sounds but it's really fun to just absorb everything and get bigger and bigger.

Definitely worth a try, if you're not sure about buying this game, there are free flash game versions out there that you can try (those aren't as polished as this one, but they have the same mechanic)."
"I do recommend but READ BELOW.

All of the 'Kingdom' games are the exact same game, except each new one adds a tiny bit more (like a DLC).
In no way at all does this game, nor kingdom 2 Crowns (the newest one), need to be a stand alone game - AT ALL.

There was a promise that all future DLC for the games would be free, so rather than make the new features as a DLC, they decided to sell them as a completely new game to gain more profit. It's a complete scam and this type of sales tactic taints the whole DLC industry (imo).

Now, with that out of the way, I really do love the Kingdom games.
I was really surprised at how much can be done with only 3 keys to operate the game (left, right, and down arrows).
I thought the music was pretty good and the game concept is original to me.
40 hours of gameplay and I still play it on occasion.

I played the free flash version on Newgrounds, and I even downloaded the game code from GitHub, and I must say that they did a great job of polishing the flash game into a real PC game - big difference.

I'm going to click that I recommend this game because it is good - but I rather recommend that you buy the last iteration Kingdom: Two Crowns because it has everything that the other two have (including this one) but it adds the last DLC too (basically). I just didn't buy Two Crowns because I didn't see the value now that I own this one, so my review is written here instead.

One last thing: I am sad that the textures are not visible in the file folders, because one thing that would make this game TWICE as good, would be the option to MOD the textures. If the game Devs can't even MOD their own textures between games, at least let me do it myself. TY"
"Disclosure: Main dev is my brother.
Fun fact: Main dev started drawing cave dungeon levels full of monsters, traps and fireballs on large sheets of paper at age 7. So he knows his stuff.

This game is a great Metroidvania full of hidden secrets. The whole game is drawn by pixel by pixel and a lot of work has been done on the light effects. Musics are beautiful. Dialogues are fun and full of surprises. Batbarian can be quite challenging when it comes to bosses but there is always a way to manage if you learn their patterns and grind a little.
If you like Metroidvanias, you'll like this one.

"[i]October, 2013 review - Steam version not yet played[/i]

This game takes place two years after the events of the first game at Maple Creek.  It is not necessary to play the first game, but I highly recommend it.  After all, [i]Maple Creek[/i] was really a good game, and you'll understand the background and implications of events in this game much better if you play MC first.

There are three difficulty settings to choose from: Casual, Advanced, and Expert.  The differences are clearly explained.  For example in Expert mode, ""Text tips give less direct hints.""   The tutorial is optional.

There are separate sliders for Music and Sound, and we can change the difficulty level at any time via our options menu (thanks devs!)  We can also turn off the voice over, custom cursor, and full screen.  Widescreen is automatically supported, and it looks great!

Whilst playing the game, be on the lookout for ""Ethereal butterflies.""  These have a bluish glow to them.  Also look for ""Illusive Objects,"" which are morphing items.  There are 30 of each to find, so plenty of fun for those of us who like hunting for these extra goodies.  

There are achievements, and you can see what you need to aim for by entering the Achievements area via your options menu.  There is also a Help button in the options menu, and this gives ten pages of illustrated, clear instructions for those not familiar with this kind of game, and/or with the evidence board element we have in the Enigmatis games.

You will see a cutscene as you load the game, and a second one when you start to play the actual game.  The loading-game video is gorgeous, but if you're scared of rats, you might want to skip this one... or close your eyes when you hear squeaking, and wait to open them until it stops. ;D  The initial video (while the game is loading) is not necessary to understand the story -- It just gives you some information about what happened a few minutes before you arrive on the scene.

Your journal has three tabs:  Objectives, Notes, and Illusive Objects.  The first two tabs are pretty useless, at least for me.  There's no extra story in there, and the objectives are pretty clear. The illusive objects are pretty easy to find... for the most part! That's where the journal gets useful.  It tracks how many of the objects you've found, what they looked like, and the order in which they [i]should [/i]be found.  If you see a '?' with objects that you've found all around it, you know that you missed an object in that specific area.

That brings me to the map, which is next to your journal.  It IS a jump-to map, but you jump to an AREA, not specific locations.  The map will show you which areas are ""active"" (only in Casual and Advanced mode) but of course you don't know exactly which scene in that area needs to have an action taken.

Never fear, though.  Your HINT button gives a directional arrow, should you need it.

The hidden object scenes vary.  We have highly interactive scenes that are more like puzzles, interactive fragmented object scenes, and the more traditional HO scenes with lists of items to find.  Most of the traditional HO's are lightly interactive, with items listed in purple needing an extra step or two.  On the list-type HOS, you can press the Notes button to play a matching game, instead of finding objects.  The matching game isn't your typical card game setup; it's literally written notes that are scattered about.  Matching requires finding a related picture, ie. a notepad would match with a pencil.

The devs did an exceptional job with story in this one, using multiple methods to progress the story.  First off we have the cutscenes, which are absolutely gorgeous.  I was VERY happy to see that I could go back and re-watch these scenes once I finished the game -- there were two in particular that were beautifully directed and ""filmed,"" and I really wanted to see them again.  Next we have story sequences that we gain as we find and place lock pieces on a particular door.  There are 12 of these story pieces, and all but the last can be rewatched at any time during the game (but not once the game is completed) by clicking on the piece(s) you've placed.  Lastly we have our Evidence Board.

What Evidence Board, you ask? The Evidence Board is an inspired addition to gameplay which is only present in the Enigmatis games (as far as I know!)  As we play the game, we gather evidence.  That's nothing new, we do that in a lot of these games!  What's new is that we literally have a board where we can organize the evidence, and as we do, we come to conclusions that progress the story.

The whole game is voiced-over, and beautifully done.  Two voices in particular gave me chills:
[spoiler]The ticket lady (after our first encounter with her), and of course the mysterious man behind the locked door.[/spoiler]
The story is engaging, and the whole game entirely immersive.  This is truly a creepy experience, and I have to say that it's one of the scariest storylines I've seen in a casual game.

It IS a scary game, but the devs injected some humor... Woohoo~!!  A Monty Python reference!  *[url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mL7n5mEmXJo]starts whistling the lumberjack song[/url]* :whistle: (added a link so no one would miss the joke!) hehehe

[b]Collector's Edition[/b] extras:
* Integrated Strategy Guide
* Bonus Chapter
* 35 Achievements
* 10 Wallpapers in three different resolutions
* 8 Concept Art
* Downloadable soundtrack - six tracks
* The ability to replay 7 hidden object puzzles
* 15 replayable cutscenes 
* 10-page Redwood Encyclopedia (very cool!)

To play the [b]Bonus Chapter[/b], simply click on the Play button on the main menu -- you can now choose between replaying the main game, or playing the bonus chapter.  This chapter takes place approximately 30 years previously, and is played from the [spoiler]ticket lady's[/spoiler] point of view.  If you've played the main game, you know how that story is going to end, but it's nice to see how things came about.  On the plus side, we actually have a reusable pocket knife on us during the whole chapter! :snicker:

The devs did such a beautiful job with this game that I have only a single gripe, and it's really a pet peeve.  As a matter of fact, I'm going to put it in spoiler tags just in case y'all didn't notice.
[spoiler]My gripe is this:  The artists chose to use the same color palette for Every. Single. Scene! Meh >_< It doesn't matter if we're inside, outside, underground, or decades in the past, every scene has the same purples and greens. *sigh*  Continuity is of course important, but you can have the same style without using all the same colors!![/spoiler]

Overall, this is an exceptional game in every way, and I thoroughly enjoyed it from start to finish!"
"I came, saw and conquered"
"Overall 7/10, but the game is fun so read on if you want a more detailed breakdown.
=======================================================================
❤ Audience ❤
☑ Beginner
☑ Casual Gamer
☐ Normal Gamer

=======================================================================
This game is very beginner friendly, would honestly do better as a phone game than PC setup.
=======================================================================
☼ Graphics ☼

===============================================================
Graphics needs aren’t intense. The game is alright looking, nothing amazing.

♬ Music ♬

☐ Alright
☑ Good 
☐ Beautiful
☐ Fantastic 
===============================================================
Music is actually fairly decent. Worth playing with the music on. Some of it reminds me
of Legend of Zelda. Battle music is pretty good as well as training music.
================================================================
☠ Difficulty ☠
☑ Ultra Easy
☐ Easy 
☐ Average
☐ Easy to learn / Hard to master
☐ Hard
☐ Unfair
=======================================================================
Going to be honest, the game is really easy. The fun aspect comes from the mini games mostly. They are fun and addicting and a good time waster. Fighting is fun, but it’s not where the main draw of this game came to me anyway. Could this game be hard? If you purposely set up handicapping rules like no training and just fighting, probably. You would be cutting out a core aspect of the game that way.
=======================================================================
§ Bugs §
☐ Bugs destroy the game
☐ Lots of bugs
☐ Few Bugs
☐ You can use them for speedrun
☑ Nothing encountered
=======================================================================
Not a single bug encountered while playing. Doesn't mean you won't, mileage always varies.
=======================================================================
☯ Story ☯
☐ There is none
☑ It exists
☐ Bad
☐ Alright
☐ Good
☐ Fantastic
=======================================================================
The plot exists solely as a way to introduce new areas to explore and beat up new enemies and collect equipment. It’s silly at best. They try to be humorous with puns here and there. It’s the type of humor aimed for children honestly and that’s okay.
=======================================================================
⚔ Gameplay ⚔
☐ Frustrating
☐ Sleepy
☐ Boring
☑ Fun
☐ Challenging
=======================================================================
If you enjoyed flash games that had you do mini games to get bonuses or to complete tasks, you will enjoy this game. If you are looking for in depth mechanics with a lot of nuance and tons of balancing in the fighting aspect, this game is not for you. This game is one meant for you to enjoy through casual play and feel powerful. The game is not meant at a serious attempt at battle mechanics. The game is Fun if you enjoy the mini games and the options given to you while fighting and trying to pick the best combos you can make. Is the game hard? No. But difficulty does not equate to levels of enjoyment. First time playing a game in this series and I enjoyed myself.
=======================================================================
۞ Game time / Length ۞
☐ Really short (0 - 3 hours)
☐ Short (4 - 8 hours)
☑ Few hours (10 - 20 hours) [if you focus on the main story]
☐ Long (40-60 hours) [if you complete everything]
☐ Very Long (61-100 hours) 
☐ Extremely Long (101+ hours) 
=======================================================================
The game length is not long. You can beat the game in a day of sitting down and hashing it out. Probably best enjoyed over a course of multiple days with a few hours. Meant mostly to be very casual. Can you farm for longer and get better stats, all the pets and stuff? Yes. Is it needed to beat the story? No. If you enjoy the collectathon in games then the game will be longer. I don’t enjoy collectathon so I’m rather glad it’s not forced.
=======================================================================
$ Price / Quality $
☐ Full price 
☑ Wait for Sale 
☐ Don't buy
☐ Refund it if you can
=======================================================================
Definitely wait for a sale. It’s not worth the full asking price. You can get better more quality games for that price. At 50% off so around $7-8 is what this game should originally retail anyway. You could honestly tell me this was a port of a phone game and I would believe it. It’s aimed at a very casual gamer audience, which is not a bad thing, but the amount of enjoyment you can get from it in terms of hours to the amount being paid for long term is almost about a dollar an hour. There are better games with better ratios for the same pricing. Definitely pick up on sale. 
======================================================================="
"Real hidden gem this one is.

This game is so fun and so interesting that you simply want more.
It never bothered me that most of the puzzles are basic because thats not the point of this game.The developers or someone close to them have real problem with carton boxes,the whole idea is totally deranged and thats why i love this game.The music fits perfectly and the voice acting and sound are very well made.
Nothing bad to say about this one,great game."
"After finishing the main story of the game, I decided to give some feedback. Some of it may seem critical, but understand that I think this game has potential and I want to see it improve. 

Just to be clear, I enjoyed the game. I would recommend it and I will probably continue to play it. 

Things I like:
-The story is much different from Pokemon. I feel that the Pokemon story has become stale over many generations. I have not played the latest game, but in the past Pokemon games that I have played the story is simply ""become the best, beat all the gyms - oh btw there's also some bad guys."" There is a very clear plot in Nexomon from the very beginning and that is what the whole game is about. 
-I like the humor. The game breaks the 4th wall frequently. I feel it even makes fun of itself and other games of this genre and I enjoyed that. 
-All of your monsters' skills pull from the same pool of stamina when you use them, unlike in pkmn where every skill has its own PP. I would often find myself trying to conserve the PP for all of the good skills in pkmn games, where in this game I can just use whatever I think is most beneficial and then recharge with an ether. Ethers are plentiful from the store and that is a good thing. 
-Every monster is clearly identified with an element when you encounter it, so you can easily know exactly how to engage with it. The element/typing system is very simple and straight forward. The typing in pkmn requires a lot more game knowledge. Sometimes a pkmn might seem to be one type but is actually another and that makes the game more difficult for new players. 
-Every monster (at least from what I've seen) evolves by naturally leveling. This is a lot more convenient than pkmn where some monsters evolve in special ways and there is no real way to know without external information. 
-The opponent always gets a turn even if you beat the previous monster with a single skill. I always felt that using a fast/powerful monster in pkmn trivializes the game since the opponent will never be able to attack in return. 
-Your monsters never really forget skills. You can customize what skills you want to use at any time outside of battle. 
-The equivalent of Master Balls are pretty plentiful in this game. I think I found 13 or so without going out of my way. Most monsters are not too hard to capture with the normal version of the item as long as you immobilize the monster in some way. 
-The art is nice, the monsters are designed well. I didn't see too many ""silly"" designs such as trash bag or ice cream pkmn. The story cut scenes were better than I expected. 
-You sort of have a traveling companion in the game, and I feel it is not too difficult to figure out what you're supposed to do next. If you go the wrong way, the game will usually tell you something along the lines of ""this isn't the right way, we need to go do this thing.""

Things I would improve:
-Many of the status effects are redundant. Sleep, paralysis, binding... they're all the same thing. Also, it seems strange that there are items to remove status effects when they only last one turn anyways (as far as I've seen). Why would you not just use a health potion? It would be nice if the status effects were diversified. 
-Many of the skills are just the same thing with bigger damage multipliers. Also, if would be nice if the damage multipliers were on the skill tooltip from the screen where you customize your monsters' skill loadout. How can I choose what skills I want to use if I don't remember how much damage they do?
-I was able to capture most of the monsters I encountered, but it would be nice if the database told you what areas you could encounter certain monsters again for people who are completionists and want to go around building a monster collection. 
-I feel that monster damage needs to be lowered across the board. Level 40 monsters can almost 2-shot a level 70 monster even without type advantage. That just doesn't seem right and it feels bad to constantly spam potions to be competitive. Because of this, I had to spend a lot of time grinding to have a comfortable advantage over the enemies. This wouldn't be so bad if there were more monster tamers in the game to battle against. 
-Some of the skills that buff defense/damage don't feel impactful enough. 
-The experience share should be given to the player much earlier in the game to help build up a well rounded team. 

Like I said, I really enjoyed the game. I think this is a good foundation and look forward to any improvements."
"Wick is exactly what Slender should've been. An intersting game with collectibles all while avoiding an urban legend/creepypasta. The story and background lore is fantastic, and the characters are pretty diverse and well made. Each one looks crazy as hell and has it's own unique way to avoid it. The game helps you find other candles and continue the night all while not being too obtrusive and clunky on the screen.

As it's own solo urban legend it actually sounds like a really intersting attraction that could be pulled off as well. I will admit there are a few times that had me kind of raging cuz of some cheap deaths, but some of them were also my fault. The game is very fair and you can generally get around the enemies easily if you know what you're doing. That doesn't mean you're safe though. 

If you're looking for a fantastic horror game to play with good lore, and fun mechanics I highly recommend Wick. The easter eggs, and jokes in the DLC alone make it worth it. If you decide to play I hope you enjoy it as much as I have."
"so, i’m going to get my one critique of the game out here first - and the rest of the review is going to be ridiculously positive. if you’re not into that kind of subjectivity, this might not help you, but i can’t resist:

for people playing on higher difficulties especially: the game should probably save more often - especially towards the end string of battles where a loss or a simple movement glitch can send you really far back for no good reason. for me playing on story mode, this was an occasionally relevant annoyance that didn’t detract from the experience - can’t speak to other difficulties.

as for everything else...

the environments, illustrated cutscenes, and animation are phenomenal, the sound design/music/voice-acting is top-notch, the costume/character design is stunning, the characters themselves & the world they live in are compelling, and the stories this game tells are those of survival, and hope - something i know i needed this year. (one of these stories is also my favorite gay male narrative to come out of any media in almost a decade - so make of that what you will.) these are people who know their stuff and they execute it exceptionally well. 

the game opens beautifully, pulls off well the common fantasy trope of dropping you into the middle of a complex universe with its own laws. at about an hour in, when you’ve become accustomed to the game, you will probably begin to wonder if this is where the game plateaus - if (like many fantasy titles by bigger studios, even) the game will sort of, be impressive for this first stretch until it gets tiring, and the lofty worldbuilding will fall out from under it and crush the game under a lore slog that outpaces your desire to read it. i.e. impressive, for an indie game, A for effort, but ultimately too ambitious. i expected this! but for me, it never reached that point - such a pleasant surprise that this easily became one of my favorite games in recent memory.

combat is simplified, stylized Dragon Age - a little clumsy, although at least still very pleasant to look at. (disclaimer: i’m vastly more interested in stories in games, and could usually care less about combat unless the two are integrated somehow. the game’s story mode felt like a good balance to me - simple enough that i didn’t struggle very much, not so simple that it felt like repetitive busy work.)

which, of course, brings me to story - and i think the game’s environment shines on its own, but the story is what really blows the doors off everything for me. it’s Fullmetal Alchemist meets UNDERTALE, in a way - a starkly human war story with an incredibly vulnerable heart. i know “indie” is hardly a genre, but hear me out: much like UNDERTALE is so much more than the snappy jaunt through skeleton town it begins as, MSAS avoids the lofty, snooty, shallow narrative of political intrigue that so often plagues socially relevant stories full of complex lore. i think that deserves to be noted specifically - at many points, it would’ve been very, very easy to fall into that trap, but MSAS keeps its feet planted firmly on the ground in a way that exceeds every other title i’ve seen that’s tried. the dialogue is tight and the message is clear - far from getting in the way, the wordy codex (usually presented as endearingly vigilant cicero’s personal journal) flows with the direction of the narrative naturally. 

this kind of dark storytelling can easily cross into the territory of either Edgy Kick-the-Dog Suckerpunch or that of Unchallenged Nihilist Escapism - MSAS on the whole does neither, balancing perfectly on the knife’s edge with the sort of subtle, deceptive brilliance of all enduring fantasy stories.

the game’s not perfect, but it was brave as hell - in my opinion, it paid off. well done."
"Within the first few moments of Guard Duty, hidden away with the enforced subtlety of a well-aimed half brick to the face, you will find a reference to 1995 point-and-click ‘classic’, Discworld. This is not by accident; Sick Chicken Studio’s debut outing less wants to be like the pixel-plotted adventure games of the 90’s and more outright wants to be one. It borrows heavily from their founding foundations, presenting inventory puzzles and bizarrely broken lateral logic atop a veneer of satire and ludicrousness. For example, Monkey Island had Guybrush, a pirate wannabe so hopeless no crew wanted any part of him. Discworld had Rincewind, a man so absolutely inept at any form of magic he could only call himself a wizard via an obscure technicality. So Guard Duty has Tondbert, who has only found employment because even guards need someone to bully.

Guard Duty invests hard in the desperate underdog trying to come good trope, setting Tondbert up as the reluctant hero swept up in the rescue of a princess whose kidnapping was only marginally his fault to begin with. He needs to track down a dark cult and put an end to their nefarious plans, and all that, but first he needs to remember where he left all his clothes after getting obliterated at the local pub the evening before. Also, a bird has nicked his helmet. Also, bees happen. Always with the bees.

That Tondbert is made the butt of all jokes is very 90’s point-and-click. He’s a goodhearted simpleton trying to get by in an often mean-spirited world that will do him few favours and instead forces him to fix all his myriad woes with whatever junk he crams into his pocket and can fashion into bizarre solutions. In this, Guard Duty strays furthest from its inspirations; though it insists you check your common sense at the door, the ridiculous solutions you’ll need to sleuth out are rarely particularly taxing. Discworld would ask you to rub a badger anticlockwise with a spoon made of apple cores at the stroke of midnight to gain access to a new area. Guard Duty just asks you to find your boots first.

"This isn't such a bad start for an early access game...  It looks pretty good, though a bit cramped even for a sub, and lacking in AI crew.

However, it still needs work to match the current standards in sub sims:

1. Periscope should show relative bearing, not just magnetic bearing.

2. We need binoculars.  Modt night attacks were conducted from the conning tower using binoculars.

3.  The sub needs a proper plotting table, to be able to mark the course of any moving objects.

4.  We need a deck gun.  Many merchantmen were sunk by gunnery from submarines.

5.  Torpedoes weren't instant kill weapons unless a warship's magazine blew up.  It took time to sink a ship, sometimes hours.  The way these ships sink is too arcadey.

6. We need decoys and to be able to launch oil and debris to throw off persistent escorts.

7. Pattern running torpedoes and sound-seeking torpedos, as well as sstraight-running steam and electric torpedoes.

8. Torpedo depth settings and magnetic influence detonators so we have the choice of direct impact or a detonation beneath the keel"
You can stab them. You can also not stab them. It's your choice.
"- $30
- Free DLC
- Funny and interesting story 
- Great gameplay
- Very, very few bugs.
- Optimized well, playing on a 1080ti, everything maxed out and fully utilizing my 144hz monitor.
- Music is insanely good. 
- you dont have to have a VR headset to enjoy this, the ported version runs great, and feels great to play. 
- 5/5 definitely glad I bought it. Cannot wait for the DLC."
The immersion really kicked in when my ears started bleeding from text-to-speech earrape.
"I had the pleasure to be a playtester for this game and I can tell you: xDasher is an exciting and enjoyable game, no matter if you play it with friends or on your own. (But I personally prefer to play it as co-op.) There are lots of levels to beat, each facing the players with different challenges through various enemy types and obstacles. Some levels are more challenging than others, but it always feels very rewarding when you finally dashed through the last enemy and the door to the next level opens. The game uses the simple dash mechanic in different ways, which makes it easy to learn, because the answer to basically everything is dash. See an enemy? Dash! See a bottomless hole in the ground? Dash! Your friends are paralyzed? Dash!   

The music is catchy, and the playable characters are adorable (the yellow one is my favourite, because the hat kind of looks like Jake the Dog). And I love the sound the barrels make while walking through them. It reminds me of bubble wrap.
 
In sum I highly recommend this game. The only thing missing is an entire level filled with barrels.  
"
"I admit, this game is something that piqued my curiosity, but was not something I would pay for, at least, directly. Then it showed up in my Humble Bundle. 

Deciding that maybe plugging through the myriad titles clogging up my library would be a good idea, I fired up [i]Subterrain[/i]. 

Dammit, dev. Why make a game that is so much fun?

[b]Pros[/b]

If you like inventory management, crafting weapons, and shooting alien zombie things, [i]Subterrain[/i] is for you. 

The game balances everything very well. Want power to the next place to visit but don't want to overload the generator? Better figure out which places to turn off so that you don't draw power, but won't be too difficult to clean back out of infected zombies. 

Enjoy backtracking to refill your backpack? Fortunately, the early areas aren't that bad. That said, later on it can be a bit tedious, but this game is fairly forgiving when it comes to passing time (Pro tip: travel the tram repeatedly if you need to speed up Research). 

Food, Water, Sleep, and Bathroom (yes, your dude will need to take care of bodily functions) are not labor intensive. Honestly, food is fairly generous in the lower difficulty settings, and it takes quite a while before you will find yourself absolutely needing to eat/drink. That said, make sure that you know where the toilets are in advance, as Dr. West is pretty good at indicating his functional needs fairly soon after eating and/or drinking a beverage. 

Gaining materials to craft is not very hard, although the game is a bit vague when it comes to figuring out where you need to go for the next upgrades for crafting/research plans. It took me a while to realize that you need to double-click logs to add them to the menu so that you can read them. The game doesn't tell you. 

[b]Cons[/b]

There is no way to ""speed up"" time without performing an action (such as riding the Tram or sleeping). This can be frustrating if you want to power through a bunch of crafting but don't want to travel outside of your safezone. 

Backpack levels can be annoying early on, especially when you find a bunch of items to recycle, but your bag will not accommodate everything, necessitating multiple trips back to the same area. While you do load in/out quickly, it's still tedious. 

While the game is good at presenting on-point tutorial windows, it is bad at timing those to sync with a relevant action. For example, one window popped up telling me how to craft upgraded power cells for the generator, yet I didn't have the ore necessary to even craft one. 

[b]Overall[/b]

If you like top-down shooters where you have to explore creepy abandoned space colonies and fight waves of zombies, then [i]Subterrain[/i] is for you. The learning curve to play is not too steep, and honestly, once you access the recycler and can start farming for raw materials to use in crafting, the game is a lot of fun. 

Thus, this gaming chick says: pick up this game."
"I loved this game back in it's heyday, and I still occasionally come back to it. That being said, the community these days abuses the mechanics to an absurd degree, the developers have stopped supporting this game, and now multiple graphical and gameplay glitches are present within the game. With Mordhau out and much better supported, just buy that."
"Edit - I received a response from the developer and instead of whining they took constructive criticism very well.   While it doesnt change my response it does show for a promising future for the game so I will change it to a thumbs up.  



This is a game with little depth unfortunately as you can only scrap so many systems before you die.  The game has a ton of potential but you need to add some spare parts to begin with then come up with a mini game to collect from an outside source - whether it is scrap from the destroyed ship or bits of asteroids you hit.  Then add some kind of nav computer that you need to keep your attention on and maybe adjust course regularly in order to get to some form of rescue.   If not its just a game of how long you can prolong death which will get boring fast.  I do not plan on refunding as it has a solid foundation,  I mean real solid from the idea to graphics,  you just need to add content as it seems rather shallow right now.   I do look forward to what the future brings with it however and will check back regularly."
"I never heard of this game and it was just sitting in my library and at the back of my backlog garthing dust. A random friend recommended it to me and between the 3 games that he picked from my library this one seemed least interesting...

I am sure glade I was 100% wrong!!

This game is an awesome RPG/Puzzle/Advanture game using multiple characters.
A band of advanturers got dragged into a world changing event and chains of events were set in motion! A monster, A gnome, an Elf and a human have to work together to save their magical world.

Good 3D rendered animation + great background artwork. The graphics are very well done a very smoothly placed and drawn. Artist did an fantastic job!!

The music are few but intriging. Not the best but fits the back ground well.

Story conversations are very interesting with a lot easter eggs about other games such as WOW. (3 pieces of copper but no arcanite crystal!!) 

The Plot is also very well written and interconnected to each other. It does gets a bit confusing at the end and I can feel a bit of rushing the game at the end so it's not perfect.

Overall it's a very fun 10-12 hours of game play that you will enjoy!!

Really no blood and violents at all so it's not game for everyone.

8.7/10 and recommended for every single casual gamers."
"Ostrich Island is a weird one.
The graphics aren't great, there's no real story, the gameplay is simple, and yet... I find myself positively enjoying this game.
It reminds me a lot of the old PlayStation games I used to play as a kid. It's a fairly simple 3D platformer. You roam around each island trying to escape. Along the way you can collect eggs, food, and treasures like hats and skins. There's also multiplayer, although I haven't tried that yet.
It's certainly not the most polished game out there, but it's just so simple and harmless and makes me grin from ear to ear. The devs are constantly providing major updates. This, along with Steam Workshop integration, means there's a constant flow of new content for the game.
Maybe I'm a bit bias because this reminds me so strongly of my childhood, but I really am enjoying this game tons."
"Great game for those who have already played every game like The Witness and Antichamber, but want more of open world puzzles with secrets."
"yuri/10, will yuri again"
"I used to drive 45 miles to play this game at the arcades. It's so great now that we have it here on Steam and for only $20! I usually wait for sales but when this game was finally released, I didn't hesitate!"
"When Raven software was at its peak and not serving the dictatorship of Activision. 
They were able to create unique game when collaborating with ID software. Hexen II was one of those games.

8.4/10 verdict: Hexen II is not perfect but it is a representation of a time of when Dev's were not afraid to inovated."
老板娘看起来好好吃
"Really well-written and charming. It's one of the most replayable and involving Choice Of games I've played. There's so much content, you can be any kind of main character you want to be, and from my experience (4 playthroughs) the outcomes of the story can be drastically different depending on who you are, which characters like you, and what you choose,

Highly recommended!"
Overall just a weird game.
"Having played a little bit at once remembered the old game ""Alchemy"" where you had to mix different components, each time getting something new. This is about the same gameplay, but complicated by the time limit. Collect different objects on the map, mix, explore. Good replayability, I recommend the game for those who like to learn games."
"The old classic, resurrected.

The game feel is a bit ""app-y"" but it works well and plays just like Slay always did.

I've been buying this game in various formats for nearly 20 years now, and I've just bought it again.

Here's hoping all of Sean's games get onto Steam."
"When I was 12 years old, I remember us telling my dad that he should get a bump on his back checked out. At the time the bump was the size of a golf ball or so. My dad ended up getting it checked out and it turned out it was a tumor, we didnt know whether or not it was a benign tumor or not but there was a surgery planned to get it removed. 

The surgery failed, the tumor was not made out of the material that they thought it was so he had to go to the hospital at a later date to get it fully removed. Once the tumor was removed we found out the the cancer had spread... it was a benign tumor. 
My dad went through intence radio therapy for two years, our doctor one day told us ""Im really supprised your still walking."" we asked ""what do you mean?"" and he replied with ""well most of my patients dont make it to every apointment walking, but you seem to always be on your feet walking on your own to every apointment. I can tell your a strong man."" That suprised most of us that day.

About 2 months after that day the doctor told us that chemo wasn't working but that there was hope of a new treatment in Columbia. So of course my dad got on a plane and flew to Colombia with Canadian merchandise and gifts for the people of Colombia, all he wanted to do was tell them that Canada had a good healthcare system and that if they knew anyone that wanted a better life then they should think about moving to Canada.

My dad came back home a week later and found out that the treatment was not working on him. The hospital told him that there was nothing that they could do. I came back from school one day and found a ""death bed"" in my mom and dad's bedroom. I didnt think much of it at the time I just knew he would be happier here at home. 

He called me into his room one day and he asked me to sit down. He told me some simple words ""You NEED to promise me that you will not stop doing the things that we said we would do after I die. You can still make a cottage, travel the world and build a car together. I know I will not be there for your marriage, or your graduation, i will not see your kids and we will not be able to travel together but you need to go on without me, life goes on... YOU go on.""

My dad was in that ""death bed"" for about a month and a half, everyday a man would come in to help him eat and drink along with other tasks. Every night a woman would come in and help my dad so that my mom could sleep. They dont call it a death bed for nothing, as he got more medicine he got less and less human. His skin turned green, he could not see my face, he could not talk, he could not hear well, he could not move, he was like a doll.

My grandmother came from Venezuela to visit my Dad and it was just me,my grandmother and my dad at home. My dad started making wierd noises from his lungs so I called my grandmother to come and we couldnt feel a pulse on his wrist. He was still breathing but his body was trying to survive so blood only traveled to the important organs like the brain and the lungs. We immedietly called everyone including the nurse to come. Everyone was home now except for my older sister who was at a party with her friends, she wasnt answering her phone so I ran to the neighboor's door and pleaded that she drive me to my sister and that my dad was dying, she said yes and we sped there and back. By the time we got back I ran to my dad and held his hand as he went in and out of consciousness until he held his breath... one. last. time. 

I cannot deny that this game brought me right back to that day, because it did and im glad that it did because its an illness that everyone should be aware of. 

Rest In Peace,
Alberto Muller"
"This is an excellent fun game. If you like Rez Infinite VR Area X, Lightbreaker Ultimate VR, or Ding Dong XL, you will enjoy this game.  There is a big problem with Steam Achievements though.

Oculus users, to work around the problem, start the game from Oculus Home.

VIVE and Mixed Reality users, hold on until you get a patch from the developer.

Developers, there is severe bug with Steam Achievements. I suggest that you disable all Steam Achievements until the bug is fixed. Please test play the game from the shortcut installed by Steam. Once you get the first achievement, you will see how it blocks the view--rendering the game unplayable."
Good game.
I paid under a dollar for this game.  This may be the best game that I've ever gotten for so little.  I have purchased several additional copies to give away as gifts.  The game is tons of fun.  Give it a go.
"fantastic game !
by far the best experience I had in VR.
it's just a very satisfying experience to explore worlds in all 3 dimensions.
most fun is is the the multiplayer mode: grabbing onto other players hands, extending the arms to bridge over bigger gaps with up to 6 people is always a laughter :)
and so far the community is always friendly and helps out new players, aswell as the developer who plays the game reguarly.

with almost 500 user created levels (at the time of writing) there's enough replayability and a good selection for beginners and advanced players.
(nice to mention: there's a in game VR level editor, a user created 2D editor (download with google ""Climbey 2 D Editor""), and a custom script that allows you to create levels within standard 3D modeling programs such a blender (currently only rectangular objects supported) (download with google ""Climbey obj converter"")).


a few words to the jumping (as it's known to be tricky for beginners):

it has learning curve for sure. the more experince you gain the better / more precise you can jump. don't expect to do crazy high 20 meters jumps within your first play session, you also don't pick up a violin and play like Vivaldi :)
you will get the precision over time.

which doesn't mean you can't finish the levels and haven't fun, as mentioned before there are easy beginner levels and if you play harder levels you can make usage of grabbing onto other people, to extend arm length or to get a free ride :)
increasing jumping skills is a ongoing and satisfying process.


the latest update switched to nightime gameplay, with a flashlight attached on your forehead, which makes the game even more immersive in my opinion. it's also a good basis for some spooky cave climbing levels... :)


tldr: fun multiplayer game for beginners & pros. lots of content & good replayability. helpful & friendly community."
"I would recommend this wonderful game to others who are interested in time travel and adventure. The game Is amazing so far in its development and the creators at Lost in Days Studio did a wonderful job making it. I absolutely love it. But there are a little bit of issues in the game but that is absolutely fine and that is how they can make it better. This game also teaches a moral lesson that is important in life throughout the story, I won't spoil it!"
"From hunting animals in the forest, to tripping out on mushrooms and fighting your inner demons, to falling in love with one of your fellow adventurers and then immediately after fighting a horde of zombies, this game succeeds perfectly at recreating the days of settling the American West where others have failed."
"I will tell my future kids that this right here is the ""Art of War"" by Sun Tzu"
"Starts cute and depressing, hits you in the nose and then... and then it says what, something like ""just a prank bro""?

This game is some sort of continuation of the the first Carpe Diem, a tiny free visual novel with a very interesting punchline. The point is, this punchline works so well because the free version was so short (I have given it a positive review).

The author failed miserably to explore the myriad of possible interesting plot lines which could easily have made this a 95% Metacritic VN. Instead of continuing with the direction of the first VN, the author decided to add all the possible plot lines from all possible animes, mix it with a shallow cliche anti-social protagonist, sparkled with random irrelevant characters and laugheable variety.

The plot is straight. There are [spoiler]only 4[/spoiler] choices throughout the game, and [spoiler]only the last[/spoiler] influences the ending. There are [spoiler]only 2[/spoiler] endings, which do not connect well to your choices. The story goes from ""hmm"" to ""already?"" to ""that escalated quickly"".

The graphics is remarkably better than the one of the first visual novel, and the voice actors were pretty good. I'd like to give kudos to the dev for choosing a girl with a normal voice, instead of a cutesy Moe voice. This fit much better the atmosphere. Sadly, my opinion is that the main force behind a Visual Novel should be the story behind it, and this story here was pretty poorly written.

Linux port is flawless (thanks to RenPy engine) and achievements are straightforward."
"Yet another great game in this series. They all have the same basic concept, but each adds its own unique twist to help keep things interesting. The puzzle design is top-notch, as is the graphical style.

If you liked the others in the series then you'll like this. The developer hasn't messed up yet.

On to the next!"

Nyanco Mine is a Minesweeper clone themed after Nyanco - there's not much to say about it other than that. I'd only recommend it for hardcore Nyanco fans, as the game offers little else. 5/10

"Let me start off and tell how I experienced the game. Some friends and I run a discord server and I often stream there for community entertainment. On a whim, i bought this game, and ended up staying up till 3 AM (my time of writing this) going through our first play through on normal with the one friend of mine crazy/stupid enough to stay up that long with me playing ""A stupid looking horror game"". 

While I will admit this is not a ""Horror"" game, this game does nail that kind of atmosphere. while I will admit this is not a GREAT game, I must admit I had a lot of fun playing it. The foundation for great things is here, it just needs some polish and tightening of screws/bolts. If you don't want spoilers, stop reading here and play the game if you're interested. Grab a friend and play this game with them and i'm convinced you'll have a good time. 


Weapons:
The weapons are an interesting bunch. You start off with a revolver you find in your dad's safe, then a baseball bat from a police car, followed up by the rifle at the hospital, and the shotgun at that cemetary. You get a laser rifle at the end of the military base area, but it comes a bit too late to be particularly useful. It's pretty much there to make the final area, death park itself, easily traversed due to the high number of monsters. I'm sure higher difficulties will find much more use than I did. All the other weapons have their place, except for the baseball bat once you reach midgame, but we'll touch on that later. You'll find yourself mostly using the shotgun once you get it. DON'T BE AFRAID TO USE THE RIFLE!!! I had way more than enough ammo for it my whole play through. The revolver is nice too, but you probably won't be using it as a main weapon

The boss:
The clown is a gross, terrifying being that kind of falls flat in his fight. He throws boxes at you then summons monsters after you shoot him. The laser cannon acts essentially like a rocket launcher in a resident evil game, except it starts off with infinite ammo, and not requiring you beat the game first. Make the clown more involved in the fight, perhaps doing the occasional slow slam or summoning monsters more often.

The plot:
Its pretty decent. not much to cover

Melee:
Oh god the bat becomes terrible once more enemies start appearing. The bat has a slow swing animation and it's hard to tell where your melee swings are. If you could smooth out the animation (have a more broad swinging motion that showes how far your melee range goes), and give the bat a midgame upgrade (such as a semi-knockback mechanic, or just more damage), it would become more useful and potentially open the door for fun melee only runs. Until then, it'll sit as a pretty decent item in the eraly game, but then quickly becoming garbage.

Other odds and ends:

This seems like the kind of game that'd have more secrets, but it doesn't. maybe add a few secret endings or special rewards? It'd also be nice if there were more clown skins that you could unlock, such as your sister since she becomes possessed. It'd also be cool if you could choose between charlie or lily. perhaps they could play a bit differently and add a bit of flare. Perhaps a bit more about where your parents go would be nice. maybe even a side story with the father? The game could be longer, but i can understand why it isn't.

Also, please make the grabbing of items or interacting better. you almost have to stop on top of an item to pick it up.

Overall:
The game is not good, but i can tell a lot of heart went into it. Its the attention to detail and obvious care the developers put into the game that makes me like it. You should support these developers, as I feel they can do great things with just a bit more polish and practice. I was surprised to see ""This was our third game"" at the credits, as most developers who make this kind of thing have made hundreds of cruddy games. I was pleasantly surprised that this game was incredibly fun to play, as well as a good stream game for my friend. Fix or add some of the things i listed, and you might have a gem on your hands. I was surprised the game was so recently published, and if it wasn't i probably wouldn't have written this.

Thank you, and good night. Angel out"
Play split screen with a friend :D
"This game is insanely hard but enjoyable at the same time. I don't really know the story behind the game but I think it's a remake of something, I'm kind of not sure because there's a bit of a language barrier thing. Anyways, it's a rogue-lite action platformer where you have to fight your way to ground level from deep underground.

The art style and pixel graphics are weird looking but nice at the same time. They just have a strange look but you get used to it. There are lots of cool animations, like a different death animation for each enemy that kills you which is pretty neat. 

The maps are procedurally generated but the enemy placement sometimes feels a bit random and on rare occasions you will start a map with an enemy attacking you with no way to avoid it. Other times you will face a huge pack of enemies right off the start but more often than not it feels alright.

The difficulty level is very hard. I died so many times playing this, you really have to play carefully and lead the enemies into bottlenecks or where you can hide from their attacks. Rushing in and swinging your sword like mad will get you killed pretty quick. The gun is okay but ammo is fairly limited and you really need to save some for the bosses, which are crazy hard. I wish there was a way to see the bosses health when you are fighting them but I didn't notice any health bars or hit points showing up. While most of the monsters felt alright to fight against the boss battles actually did feel a bit unfair. I imagine leveling up your character and unlocking skills would help with this a lot so you may have to grind a bit. Your stats and skills are permanent so if you die you still have them so that may ease to difficulty with bosses.

Something I think could be better was the camera. To pick up items you have to press up and to get out of the mech suit you press down and whenever you do this, and sometimes just playing, your camera will flick around when you tap up or down. This can be pretty annoying sometimes and could be fixed by adding a half second delay between tapping up or down and having the camera pan up or down. That would fix this issue totally and still give you the ability to see a bit more above or below you.

The dialogue in the game can be funny at times. It was translated from Japanese I think, and it's mostly good but here and there are a couple slip ups but when you come across them it kind of makes it funny and I love that type of thing.

Overall this game is alright for it's price. It has some problems but you can get past most of them after a while. If you're looking for a very difficult rogue-lite, this is definitely one of those. If you find very difficult games unappealing then you may want to skip this. I like it, it's a bit weird in many ways but it that kind of grows on you after a while."
"This game makes me feel stupid in the best possible way. Absolutely stunning graphics, cute characters, perfect puzzles & a wonderful mechanic that's super easy to understand."
"Options are simple enough, with Subtitles (NOT the default), Disable Effects, Windowed or Full-screen, and a range of resolutions from 640x480 up to 1920x1080.  I played the game entirely with my controller with no issues.

[i]Oxenfree[/i] is a compelling game for those who love dynamic story-games.  Replayability is added to by having multiple endings and a variety of achievements.  This is not a ""I have no idea what to do next,"" kind of game with impossible puzzles and obtuse logic.  It's all about the journey.

The graphics are not what I'd call compelling, but coupled with the stellar soundtrack, voices, and story, they set the stage for an environmental journey that will keep you riveted throughout.  You can see from the screenshots that the people are not super-detailed, and yet you can tell that the devs put some care into their mannerisms and movements.  For instance, when walking down a steep incline, the characters will lean way back and have the kind of jerky steps one has when they're trying not to lose control of their descent.  Little touches that add some realism and suck you deeper into the world they're created.

Gameplay consists of 2.5D exploring, discovering secrets, and interactions with the people around you.  You will generally have three options to choose from during conversations, and your choices [i]absolutely[/i] matter.  There are color-coded thought bubbles that show you which character is speaking, and if a face shows up in that bubble, it means that the character either feels closer to that person, or the opposite, depending on the situation.  Along the way you will discover a compelling story with plenty of ""What the HELL?"" moments.

The characters themselves have well-defined, believable personalities that are absolutely evocative of the teen years, from their mannerisms right down to their word choices and life decisions.  This is not to say that they're annoyingly ""angsty""... just that the devs did a beautiful job capturing their individual personalities.  The voice actors are masterful in their delivery, bringing them all even more to life.

The soundtrack and sound effects range from beautiful to thought-provoking to downright creepy, and all of it atmospheric.

There is one thing that I found semi-annoying about the game, and that is the loading screens.  They're artfully placed in a manner that is reminiscent of the breaks producers add to their shows to allow commercial lead-ins, but I still would have been happier without them.  I also enjoyed the first half of the game more than the second half, with the difference being more interaction with the unknown in the beginning, and more character-development in the latter parts... but that could also be because I was off exploring and looking for secrets instead of progressing the story.

There are 13 achievements to be had, and it will take multiple play-throughs to get them all... The idea of playing again is OK by me, since there are multiple endings!  I managed to get 5 achievements and the second-best ending during my play-through, but I'd like to see where else the story can take me.  There are also five behind-the-scenes documentaries, but when I click to look at them, it just takes me to a loading screen, then back to the page you see upon entering the game.  Not sure what's up with that *shrugs*

If anything in this review sounds enticing to you, then I think that you'll love the game.  Absolutely recommended!"
"A quite simple game, find 100 snails in a single illustrations by going up and down using your mouse. This one is easier than the bird one :)"

"Summary: Surprisingly pretty good. I love the atmosphere. Very much enjoyed my experience. Winged Cloud... Take notes. Just saying. -cough cough- . But this game is brutal. Save often. No shits will be given for your mistakes. You will regret alot of your life choices. Good character developement. Good storytelling. Good BG/Character Art. 

Pros:
-creative fear inducing aspects
-creative premise 
-a nice change of pace from other VNs
-Many variety of choices
-2spooky4me

cons:
-Too kawaii([spoiler] Himeno	[/spoiler])
-Choices can be somewhat ambigous or irrelevant at times
-Probably won't be going to an aquarium anytime soon
-One character in particular WILL piss you off alot([spoiler] Sayo [/spoiler])
-Won't be able to keep pet fish anymore

Overall: Definitely worth a try from those who enjoy VNs or spooky games. Those who like both of these genre's will be pleased. Good buy. Very much worth the price. If you have time to play sakura swim club, you have time to play this. So stop fapping and get spooked by these pretty good VN"
"Mixed. A grindy mobile-port that is a solid Tower Defense game. I can only recommend this to those that cannot get enough TD gameplay. It does not do anything new, exciting or special. It forces replays of levels to be able to complete future levels. 

I do feel that I paid the appropriate amount for this game when I got it a a few years ago.

"There are a fair number of horror games out there. Many of them, to be candid, are fairly bad if not downright awful. The issue being that a lot of the time games in this genre seem to want to follow a set list. There is somewhat a rigid rulebook on how horror games are meant to be, but these rules aren’t supposed to be one hundred percent abided by. Developers can and should, for the most part, make up the rules and experiment as much as they want. At the end of the day I find that it’s the somewhat unique games that capture people’s attention.
Now I’m not saying Detention is unique, I mean let’s face it what is unique nowadays? However it does like to throw in its own little rulebook. 

The summary of the plot is; you start off the game as a male student named Wei who falls asleep in class. Hours later he wakes up alone in a dark and obviously quite spooky school. After sometime  exploring he comes across a girl sitting asleep on the school stage. He wakes her up and things start really kicking off. A lot of weird stuff starts happening around the school and creatures called Lingered start appearing. These seem to be undead students and teachers and are the first enemies you come across. They’re slow creatures which, like the rest of the enemies in the game, seem to have a hunger for anything that breathes. Luckily there’s a useful mechanic that can help with that. By clicking the right mouse button, or whichever button it’s been mapped to, Wei or Ray will hold their breath. This allows for you to scamper on past the Lingered without them attacking, however you will have to catch your breath if you hold for too long. 

Detention plays out as a point and click horror game where you will need to solve puzzles in order to progress. Some of the puzzles can be fairly straight forward, for example using an umbrella to fetch a key from a ventilation shaft. But others require a bit of thought to them. One example was where I had to look at three clock faces. Two had hands and the one in the middle didn’t. There was then three pictures, each with a bloody symbol on them. These symbols represented the clock hands and once I’d adjusted the clocks to the correct times the door that was previously locked opened. Some puzzles do require certain items to complete them. These items aren’t too difficult to come across, you just need to be a little bit observant. The puzzles themselves don’t feel too tedious or pointless. There’s always a valid reason to complete them and most of the time it’s to move the story forward.

Graphics wise I’d say detention has an unusual but very well done art style. It’s clear the artist took a lot of time to add in as much detail as possible to give the game a sense of reality. Each area is well drawn, with clear distinctions from the odd dark world, with it’s grainy overly, to the creepy school at night. The characters and enemies are defined too. With Wei and Ray wearing very white school uniforms and the enemies seemingly very dark and shadowy. 

In conclusion I think Detention is a horror game that tries to break the mold of the genres standards. But does it? Yes and no. There are a few things that really shine for me in Detention. The story is pretty complex but welcome, as I know of many horror games that have little to no story at all. Also I like the various stealth mechanics that are introduced for the number of enemies you have to face. It does throw in the odd jumpscare here and there, but I mean what horror games doesn’t. 
It’s got puzzles of varying difficulties and an eerie soundtrack that fits the game’s quite chilling atmosphere. All in all if you love horror games and want something a little different than the norm then I’d suggest giving Detention a go. And even if you don’t want it for the horror aspect, it’s full of puzzles to test your wits too. Good Day!"
"This game was so good, they even made a spinoff called 'Call of Duty'"
"Please fix Williams Bundle 6.  Many of us cabinet users have issues with jerky/laggy play. All of my hardware exceeds your requirements by a long shot.   I have emailed many times for a resolve...sent analytic data as requested, was told it was a shutter speed problem and a fix was coming....was never fixed.  The tables play horribly.  I have all of your tables and love them...please keep creating them...but I need these fixed please.  Note that the other 100+ tables play perfectly....so it is not my problem, it is on your end.  None of my emails are not being responded to....I have emailed multiple times over the past 2 months, both to the person was was initially helping me and to the support email address on your Zen page...no responses.  I would not recommend any cabinet users purchase this bundle until it is fixed.  Also, Zen, you all may want to look at the discussion threads on the FX3 Facebook groups!  I’m not the only one with this problem and you may glean a lot of valuable information from those who pay your bills..,..us customers."
Competitive International Championship when?
music so fuкing good
"Doesn't look like much but is the most addictive game I've played in decades. Seriously.
+ Most levels give you total freedom, a couple won't let you build overpasses for extra difficulty but that's it.
+ 80 levels (76 playable)
+ Fast loading
+ Easy to get into
+ Very cheaply priced and no ads or in-game buy to win BS

- No undo button. Would seriously need one.
- Some graphic glitches (very rare and do not affect gameplay)
- 4 of the 80 levels are non-scoring ""non-levels"" for some crazy reason, why???
- Only two achievents; one for total score of 25K and I'm over 31,5K already :-D
- Never did like 8-bit ""retro"" pixelated graphics (had enough of that back in 1980's)
If you enjoy brain puzzles and games like SimCity or Skylines, you will love this seemingly simple game with a lot of depth to it. Was certainly worth buying."
"I love space, I love astronauts, I love puzzes, this is perfect! for those who want to play something more peaceful than among us, I recommend!"
"I would recommend anyone who enjoys turn based games to give Shadow Magic a shot. It is a of game that superficially seems rather simplistic with its movements and hex board, but upon closer inspection a plethora of various elements are revealed. This game can give several tactics, such as creating an amphibious army of dwarves, a flying army of leprechauns, and explosive goblins. The balance between unit production and economic policy focus is just right. The only downside that I could say about this game is the possibility that, due to how attacks and damage rolls are done, luck can ruin your day. That and heroes are arrow and bullet magnets because of how powerful they can be if they aren't restrained. Needless to say, these do not detract from the possibility of fielding an army of flying hobbits that can rain havoc and drop flaming meteors on fiendish skeletons. If that has any sort of appeal to you, pick this game up. And do note that there is a sequel, Age of Wonders 3, in the works."
"Current games: ""Oh no no no we can't provide ultra widescreen support. Far too advanced and too early adoption.""

Literally 20 year old game: ""Uhh here you go. Oh and even the cutscenes work on ultra wide.""

"A free uncensored patch is provided by the developers so make sure you install Seek Girl - Patch from the DLC page before playing.

This is a fairly short whack-a-mole game with lewd content. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) The goal of each level is to boop a chibi girl that randomly appears onscreen with a mallet to clear tiles and uncover the sexy picture underneath. You only need to click the chibi girl once for the hit to count everytime she appears, no need to spamclick. After clicking the chibi girl three times for each of the nine tiles to completely reveal the picture, you need to boop the chibi girl an additional five times to unlock the animated nude version of the CG and proceed to the next level. The animation isn't that interesting, it's basically just a looping track of the nude girl gyrating or bouncing up and down (in some levels there is penetration with male genitalia or a sex toy ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)). The girls in the CGs themselves are incredibly beautiful, and many of them are in poses that show off their massive breasts (including nipples), tight pink slits (unfortunately no spreading so there's no vaginal flesh on display) and butts. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) Some of the CGs are pretty arousing even in the clothed version, with plenty of upskirt and panty shots. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) The animated CGs are also accompanied by random erotic sounds, though they don't match the artwork at all such as blowjob slurping noises and pelvis-on-pelvis missionary thrusting sounds. 

There are a total of 12 girls in the base game, and the Charming Girl DLC adds another 8 girls for a total of 20 extremely gorgeous, nubile babes. To be perfectly honest, the gameplay to unlock the CGs in this game is unsatisfying and isn't very engaging, but the welldrawn erotic artwork is definitely worth the effort of playing through the game. If you love admiring the beautiful female form, I highly recommend getting both this game and the DLC which almost doubles the content of the game for such a cheap price."
"Children of the Nile is the more modern version of the old citybuilders like Pharaoh And Zeus, allowing you to build a city in ancient Egypt. Some of the more modern things are, aside from the obvious graphics being different, that you no longer need to worry about intersections sending your supply and maintenance people entirely the wrong direction. You can now actually focus on building a city, rather than having to puzzle out the most efficient way to place buildings without them collapsing, catching fire, and starving because the food vendor doesn't show up there.

Citizens in your city are in a class society. From top to bottom, they are the pharaoh. That is you, and your family. You have a palace, and your family goes out to collect any sort of material, be it luxury goods or a humble pot to store things in. You are the state. All food belonging to the city also belongs to you, but you will always have a nice supply of food stored away in your palace. Pharaoh gets first pick, and a percentage of all food farmed in taxes. 
Just below you are the nobles, who live in large houses and get their income from the farmers under them, and in order to support a large farming population, you will need nobles to guide them.
Under the nobles are the educated elite. Priests, scribes, overseers, and commanders of the military. They have similar demands as nobles in terms of luxuries, but they are paid by the government for their services. Only the sons of nobles and luxury shopkeepers qualify for education. These are the doctors, the administration, and the tax collectors. Because nobles will try to dodge paying taxes, a scribe can catalogue how many fields have been sown so that you know exactly how much belongs to Pharaoh.

Under them still, the middle class. Entertainers and shopkeepers. These earn their bread through their services and the goods they sell. Simple, but neccesary for society to function.
Below them, the peasantry. Farmers and servants. The farmers work the land and earn enough food to last until next harvest in doing so, and the servants do the shopping for nobles and collect resources for luxury shopkeepers - So they don't have to mingle with the common folk.
Separate from them all are government workers. They fit somewhere between the middle class and peasantry, and are paid generously by Pharaoh's bread. They are the brickmakers, the construction workers for bigger buildings(Small buildings like a servant's shack are made by the servants themselves), and anything else government wants from a papyrus maker up to the military.

If at any time your system fails and the people are without food, they will leave their jobs to scavenge for it. Dates, pomegranades, fish and so on are plentiful, so you need not fear you'll ruin your city and have a ghost town.

The game starts slow every map, as you have 10 bricks(Enough for one baker, brickmakers huts don't need bricks), and only one educated person in your city at the start. So you will want to build a school and several brickmakers more to ensure you can keep growing. Before you know it, you've spend several hours building. There is no immigration either, from what I can find. You start the map with 200-300 citizens living in huts, scavenging off the land. After that, children will be your main population growth. This becomes an issue when you want a big military, as military men don't get married - They live in their barracks-tent with two other men.

Some things that are bad, there are a lot of shrines out there that will take a bit to figure out which goes where and which are popular - If you even have room for them. Sometimes your citizens or a merchant may get stuck on a corner, and sometimes you may find your labourers can't figure out which limestone block they want to pull, and manage to fail to move any of them. 

In the end, it's still a pretty and somewhat relaxing game where you can spend hours getting your city just right, and then decide to change it up again because you have a new idea. Cosmetic things like gardens, plazas and trees are free to place too, so you can make it look good without having to worry about your workers spending ages watering the plants and not farming.

Worth grabbing it if you like citybuilding, it's good at what it does"
Super enjoyable for a night of couch-coop with friends! And since it's still hard to meet up now: works great with Steam Remote Play Together.
"Chicken Invaders 2 is a shoot ‘em up game developed by InterAction studios. This is the 2nd game in the series. The first Chicken Invaders was release well over 15 years ago so a lot of people, like me, who play this game will have nostalgia if they played the first one back in the day. The game has Alien invaders type gameplay where you’re on a ship defending earth against these evil space chickens.

[h1]
Graphics:
[/h1]

The game features regular run of the mill graphics which are okay for this arcade type gameplay. They’re not that pleasing to the eyes. The FPS is also locked at 30 which is always a bad thing.

[h1]
Sound:
[/h1]

While the music is very nice there’s not much variety of it. The sound effects like chicken dying can be hilarious but hearing them again and again can be pretty annoying.

[h1]
Gameplay:
[/h1]

The gameplay of this game is very simple. It’s very simple to Alien invaders game where you get a bunch of enemies trying to kill you. You’re on the ship and you get 5 lives. The enemy chickens come in a few different varieties like parachuting chickens, regular chickens. Other than chickens you will frequently get asteroid waves. The chickens lay eggs which can kill you, so you must avoid these. You cannot shoot them you must avoid them. Since you can move anywhere on the screen with your mouse, dodging these slow moving eggs is not that difficult. The asteroid waves will throw a whole bunch of asteroids at you and you must avoid these. One of the asteroid waves has you destroy an asteroid. If you have played a game called “Pang”, this level is sort of like that. A giant asteroid is incoming and when you shoot it, small asteroids will spawn out of it and even smaller asteroids spawn out of these small ones too. So you must destroy all the small asteroids to advance to the next wave.

There’s a total of 11 levels in the game. These being the planets and Sun. You start off approaching Pluto and once you’ve done that level you move on to Neptune and you go on like this till you get to the Sun. Each level has 10 waves which are a mixture of different enemy types. Every 9th wave you get a bonus level and at this level a bonus invader ship can spawn and when you kill it you will get a power up. At the end of 9 waves of a level you’ll get a boss fight which is a giant chicken or a giant egg.

Chickens and asteroids drop things which they’re killed. Mostly chicken drumsticks and coins. Collecting these will give you points. There are power ups drops as well. The weapon drops are in gift boxes and depending on their color you can tell which weapon it is. If you already have that weapon and you pick up the gift box, you’ll get a power upgrade on your weapon. There’s also a power up item dropped which sort of looks like an atom(?). This will upgrade your weapon and make it powerful. There’s 3 different types of weapons. A red weapon which is a regular weapon and once you start upgrading it with power ups it’ll start to spread fire. The green weapon is sort of electricity type, it’s very powerful and fast. Then there is the yellow laser weapon which shoots waves of giant lasers. Each time you die your weapon power will decrease by one level.

There are checkpoints after every level and you even start off at with the power up and weapon you had when your game was over. Clicking the mouse button 1 rapidly makes your ship fire faster and by right clicking you can launch a missile which wipes all the enemies on the screen.

A short gameplay video can be found below:

Conclusion:
[/h1]

This game is very nice. If you like Alien invaders type arcade action, this is the game for you. It’s filled with hilarious stuff and I highly recommend it. If you’re bored this can help you kill time easily and it’s very cheap too."
"Be me 
Start game
Confident I can overcome most threats
Few hours into the game I have a handgun and some matches
See large zombie chained next to a chest
My greed gets the better of me as I deperately hope for long awaited good supplies in the chest
I steady my nerves and draw the pistol
My aim sways since I am still new
Line up shot of large beast of a zombie
Finally pull the trigger
Direct hit
Notice zombie still grunting 
My heart beat rises as I realise I have only made him angry
He breaks his restraints and picks up a chainsaw
I turn to flee and realise my mistake
The noise from my pistol alerted the horde
They pour in behind me from the windows and breaking down a door
I punch one before being hit and shoving another
I flee through the newly broken door the horde running after me along with the newly freed butcher
Desperently make my way to a gate
Locked
The horde advances
Quickly kick down door of house next to gate 
I start to panic as I realise the door I went through was the only exit
Run up stairs to try to stall the horde with what few pistol shots I have left
There is the corner on a chair I see it
A crossbow
I sprit to it and pick it up 
The horde has already broken in the door and is making their way up the stairs
All I hear the the hordes screams and the butchers chainsaw
I take shakey aim with the cross bow as my last hope
Fire
Its an Explosive bolt!
The horde is cut to pieces and those not dead on the ground
This is my chance
The butcher now seeing me and fully awake sprints at me
I shoot and hit directly in the chest
The bolt explodes and he is still standing
While he is dazed from the explosion I make my way down stairs
I craft another bolt from traps I disarmed earlier
He shambles down the stairs after 
Take my last panicked shot
Upper chest
It explodes he goes down
Burn the bodies
Overwelming sense of victory and bad assery flood my body 11/10 would recommend"
"First of all I would like to say that I am really happy with the new Japanese names and all.

I had a fun time with the first Cherry Tree game.
This game though, takes it even further. I really love how they continue with the story.
I also like the new characters, they make a really great combination with the characters who were already in the game.
The game also shows the relationships with people of all characters instead of only the main character, I am not going to spoil.. but this game really chose the right way. 

If you loved the first game, you will enjoy this game even more! It is a very nice part two.
"
"This game is awesome! I love to play it with my cousins. The sound effects are awesome and the zombies are hilarious. My favorite weapon is the snail snot rock. It's fun to get the zombies in all kinds of way.
This game is so much fun!"
"Friend got it for me as a gift to play multiplayer, we saw later that they don't support multiplayer anymore.
So I think that multiplayer should be gone from the presentation of this game."
"I played this game as a kid and enjoyed it a lot, but unfortunately the steam version is even more broken that the game from about ten years ago. There is at least one secret level in this game, but it won't load for you no matter what compatibility settings you use as if some files are missing. The multiplayer also doesn't work, displaying a game-crashing error when you try to join the single available suspicious looking lobby. There is an English language version, but the in-game input is still in Russian. Also the Steam overlay doesn't work, but it's quite common for older titles and therefore the least important part of this review.

EDIT:
The most glitched level would be The Pirate Island in which the coconuts monkeys throw at you are visually stopped mid-air while their hitbox works as intended and using a shortcut at the end of the lap makes the game think you're running in the wrong direction. Also what I didn't know at the time I first wrote the review was that you can't even finish the game because after you complete the boss stage the game crashes giving off the same error that you get for trying to access a secret level. Also the Moon stage lacks enemies present in the other versions of the game. There were supposed to be those professor-made roboticized ostriches coming at you from the direction you're running towards, but I've replayed the stage three times and didn't see a single one of them."
"This is definately an older game at this point, but a very enjoyable old school RTS. I played it back before it was on steam (and eventually lost my copy, and was so excited that I immediately bought three copies for me and others.)

It has more races than any other RTS I've seen.
It has more resources than any other RTS I've seen.
It has heros, it has leveling, and it has dragons.

It's also the only game I've seen that makes the phrase, ""Spring is in the air!"" send shivers of fear for your imminant doom down your spine."
"According to Bartle's Gamer Test I'm 93% Explorer, so I guess the game hit my soft spot.  You're being taken on a ride through an abandoned monster safari park, and your quest is to take photos of the different life forms in their different conditions. The (monster) design is unique, the names are creative, the animation super cute and the environment beautiful, the underwater section is my favorite. It's a cute and relaxing game that made me want to return and explore more. Thumb up."
"The Cave is set up like an old-school 2D side-scroller.  Seven adventurers, each with a dark past, go down into a magical cave in a journey of self discovery.  At the beginning of the game (which is narrated throughout by The Cave itself), you choose three of the seven advernturers and descend.  Each section of The Cave is a puzzle that requires your three characters to work together.  Three of the sections are uniquely designed (by the sentient Cave) for the characters you've chosen.  In this way, The Cave encourages you to play though multiple times.

The drawback is that there's also three generic puzzle sections which you cannot skip.  I'm on my second playthrough, and while it's nice that the game shuffles the order of the puzzles, it can be a drag to re-solve old puzzles to get to new content.  And the achievements require you to play through the game... I don't know how many times, but I imagine The Cave's jokes (while clever) will start to wear thin on the fifth playthrough.  If you really want to get 100% achievements, you might consider reviewing the achievement list online before you play, despite the mild spoilers.

I'd still recommend this game - the humor, art and story make this puzzle game very enjoyable and encourage multiple playthroughs.  May get monotonous if you're looking for all the achievements.

A definite buy if it's on sale."
"I'm writing this while driving as a passenger in the bus because I've nothing else to do

Saw a thumbleweed, got excited
Cacti are cool

Good game"
"I really like this ice fishing game a lot of fun ,great graphics too,it's almost like you really are out there on the ice.i recommend this game for fishing lovers!"
good game. good ideas for pieces would love to see more modes and pieces
Lovely game.
"Deep beneath the wave of massive hate and dislike on this game, I have to recommend it. It's hard. It has a high end curve of learning. Especially at the beginning. The game doesn't really points out what are you supposed to do with certain characters or if it's better to work at the pizzeria rather than at the construction, but this means that it is up to the player to find out what is best. Better start to pay attention to the mechanics of the game. The game puts the player in the position to dig and learn about it, rather than showing everything just from the start. Better start another game if you find out that you are losing more stats than gaining, or learning that is better to rotate exercises than just keep doing the same one all over again. Nonetheless, the game does gives you advice and it is up to the player if he wants to really hear them or just keep playing and being ""punished"" for not listening. For example: there is a point at the start of the game where Frank calls you and tells you to read a little magazine he had when he was young fighter just like you. There, the game mildly tells you that you shouldn't focus in increasing all of your stats, but strive for just one. Thus putting you to embrace only agility, stamina or strength. But also, you shouldn't focus only in increasing your stat, but in learning a new move or skill daily. Yeah, this straightforward advice will be necessary later in the game. So, you should put attention to every detail of advice the game gives you and start recording every info or mechanic you discover because you are on your own to find out how to beat this game. The fun is in the actual play & learn, the funny tidbits and references to pop-culture, and discovering mechanics so that you can improve progressively. After you discover how it works, you'll fly smoothly throught it."
"Very short but I liked it. I hope there will be episodes from other characters too.
Now excuse me while I go and  re-play the main game..."
"Penny Arcade's On the Rain-Slick Precipice of Darkness 3 is a comedic RPG with some parody elements and convenient features. I can't tell you too much about the story, as I don't want to spoil the game. Also, I can't fill you in on the backstory because... I haven't played the first two games. The reason I started on this game, and the fourth, is because they were in a pack and I had played the previous two games the new developers had done before getting asked to do these, which were Breath of Death VII and Cthulhu Saves the World. That's where my perspective is coming from, so keep it in mind. Basically, you're a company that investigates supernatural happenings, and supernatural things happen. So... you investigate them. That's really all I can tell you without getting into potential spoiler territory.

You can explore specific locations on a world map with well defined places to go. Inside these places, you can search for treasure, battles, and main plot points for going there. While there is some interesting story and dialogue, the battles are the meat and potatoes of the game. The battles are nice because they are not random. Instead, they are represented by monsters clearly visible on the map. You battle in a turn based fashion, however there's a meter on the top of the screen. This determines the order the combatants will attack. It will be initially set by speed stats and certain passives, but it can also be changed by using slows, stuns, and interruptions. A combatant can also move up their position on the command line by defending, although this will not allow them to attack on that turn. So why bother? Well, to reduce major damage from a major attack, or possibly to help utilize another interesting mechanic. In this game, you don't have a pool of MP to work with. Instead, you start battles with zero MP and gain 1 MP per turn. So if you want to build it up, you can use items, use certain abilities to boost it, or simply do something that does not require MP. This forces you to manage your health and position on the timeline much more carefully, rather than having magic users spam abilities right from the get go. 

So what gives you your abilities? Well, each character starts with their own class. The classes dictate what abilities, passive or active, these characters have. This will affect how you use them. Beyond this, as the game goes on you will receive badges, each with their own additional classes. You get to add one, and eventually two, to each party memeber. This gives them a total of three classes, and many possibilities on how you can build them. However, badges can only be on one person at a time, so you can't use the same class on every character at once. All of the badges and characters level up as you win battles, although the ones you actively use will level up faster. Also, you can further customize your characters with equipment as well.

This game is full of conveniences, such as the aforementioned blanket leveling and visible battles. Whenever you finish a battle, all characters are revived and restored. If you lose a battle, you get to try it again. You can save or change badges at any point. Convenient traveling through an easy world map, with shops in fixed positions and a training area to grind if needed. The game does a lot to try and ease the burdens of RPGs while still being an RPG. 

However, I found a few things a bit disappointing. One is that there are too many classes leveling up constantly. It seems that after every battle, at least one if not multiple classes gain levels and often new abilities, which is a lot to look at and manage. You'll be constantly checking your new abilities to see what they do and who they will be good for, depending on how you're trying to build characters. Plus, the fighting system is somewhat complex for newcomers, which detracts from the game's convenience factor a bit. Also, while the game tries to teach you one thing at a time to gradually get you familiar with the gameplay (which I like), it feels like once you finally understand how to fight and manage your badges and equipment and strategize, the game is basically done. It also ends on a cliffhanger story-wise. So, this whole game essentially feels like it is a buildup for the sequel, both in story and basic gameplay ideas. Although the sequel (which I will review once I finish) is rather different in some aspects. I guess I just felt like the game was getting me ready for the real adventure to start, and then it abruptly ended. 

Overall, it's still a good game. Fun for people new to RPGs and looking for good value games. The characters and story have enough charm to carry some of the weight. Plus all the conveniences, well paced learning curve, and constant upgrades to manage, make for an entertaining experience throughout. I guess it's good that the game left me wanting more rather than being sick of it, and the extra mode recommended after you finish the main game gives it some more for you to play and satisfy your cravings. However, I'd say that if you're looking at this game, which is only 5 dollars alone, you might as well just pay the 8 bucks and get the two pack because you'll be well prepared to take on the fourth game after this. I got them both on sale for a dollar which was well worth the price. Judging this game on its own, I'd give Penny Arcade's On the Rain-Slick Precipice of Darkness 3 a solid 6 out of 10 for being an engaging RPG experience without the common headaches that befall so many other RPGs."

"Essentially Castlevania without any Castlevania, but feels like Castlevania and made by the same guy who created Castlevania, but was made to be Legally distinct from Castlevania, because the company that owns Castlevania doesn't want anyone to use Castlevania, because they want to make Castlevania themed slot machines in order to profit off of the IP of Castlevania.

"Fun game, I think It's worth the 5 dollars. But you can tell it's early access. there are some occasional hiccups here and there. Like a bit of stuttering and slight pauses, I've seen a bit of screen tearing as well. I hope in the future there will be a lot more added to the settings like control mapping and adjusting the Resolution. At the moment the settings menu is very very bare.

The Music is cute and fitting for each level, the Idle animation with the Nintendo Switch is cute; a little Easter egg to the Mario like style that the game is inspired from. The Art style is nice and simple, very pleasing to the eye. Overall this is a cute game. Controls are smooth and simple, easy to pick up. BUT there are occasional hiccups.

Good Game, There's still quite a bit of work to be done at the moment it just reminds me of a mobile/flash game. I hope in the future a badge system will be added as well.

Can't wait to see what happens when it comes out of early access."
"Saw this game and was like ""that looks pretty decent.""
Turns out it is, and then some.
True story.

Sound - Pulsing and grungy.
Graphics - Looks like a getaway drivers snuff film.
Gameplay - Makes you feel like badass getaway driver, never lets you feel like you're too safe.
Other - Loads of cars and upgrades, dedicated photo cam."
Thanks to Civvie for the recommendation! great game and very enjoyable to play from time to time.
good game!
"I really want to like this game, but the core loop of building the reliability up on rockets for them to still feel like a 1 in 10 chance to explode when at 99% reliability isn't fun. I wish the game had a prototyping stage where you sink time and money to get a slow increase in reliability so that when a rocket blows up, it feels like either I'm at fault for shorting on development time or the result of various factors interacting in unforeseen ways.

Another thing that feels extremely lacking in this game is the contracts system. Right now it's just fiddle with the slider to underbid by the lowest amount possible, which just means you have to have the screen open the entire time, waiting for the ai to make its bids. If the developer really wants to keep the slider they should implement a reputation system or something of the sort. That way at the beginning you're being forced to bid much lower than the other established launch providers and there's more risk in pushing a rocket out of development early. Then, as you progress along in the game, and build your reputation, you'd be able to gain contracts while bidding slightly higher than the ai due to your established name and low frequency of sudden unplanned disassembly in mid flight.

As I said, I really want to like this game, and I'm sure as the dev builds on it, it'll get there. But, as it stands right now, the game is more frustration and irritation than enjoyment."
"Q3:TA adds a ton of great maps, game modes, bots that learn, etc. Fun way to play Quake3. Only downside is no custom resolution support out of the gate (4:3 video modes are all that seem to work. My monitor uses 16:10 (1650x1050) and there's no option for it so I'm playing windowed 1024x768. Other than that Q3:TA is a pretty fun FPS."

Issues? Yes, you need download the Free DLC Patch to SEE 9/12 babes in the artworks. Otherwise, you can still finish the game, BUT you will not see the gorgeous anime chicks in 9/12 puzzles and will just see the room they are in.

"This Game is a awesome vision of a new kind of Gameplay \ Winter Simulation. Much better as the Prog-Try´s of Astragon \ Rondomedia or UIG a few years ago. Ok. My favorite in Winter-Ski Resort Simulation will always be: Ski Region Simulator 2012 from Giants, but HR Innoways makes a real big difference with this Game. But: The only contra that I can give at the moment is the control of Gamepads like X360 or X-Box One Ctrl. It´s horrible. Sometimes impossible to play the game, because the NPC is moving alone and the camera is turning in other ways. The Parameter Setting can´t change that problem. If HR Innoways will stay on the Development and fix this with a Update it will be my absolute favorite Winter Game. (of course also with Steep). A Must Have for all technic freaks. Learn the Controlling of a Cable Railway.

"This is the new SimGolf, make no mistake. I'm only one hour in and it's [b]flagrantly awesome hole-design bliss[/b].

The crafting tools are brilliant and intuitive, and worth the entry price alone.

Some other reviewers have pointed out that the future elements, while they do add flavor (and creative depth), they're a bit heavy-handed... Reminds me of SNES F-Zero in how it applied arcade/pinball mechanics to racing. Fun, absolutely, but also loses the tradition of classic racing (or golf, in this case). I'd be extremely willing to pay extra for a ""classic mode"" DLC or good user mod.

Workshop support was what sold me. This is very good...

UPDATED: After finishing my first full 18-hole course (~20 hours in), I'll add that (1) the crazy elements are actually a lot of fun to work with and (2) it's entirely possible to build a course without them... Really excited for this game, and I can't recommend it as-is enough."
"Super badass game.
ONE HUGE AND SUPER BAD ISSUE:

LET US INCREASE THE MUSIC EVEN HIGHER, THE BEAT IS TOO FIRE FOR IT TO BE SO LOW!"
i was playing this while eating mc donalds my life was good until mc donalds dropped out of hand because i got scare by creep little man hump chair why do he do this. when my big mac fell out of hand i could not breathe was so upset because man hump chair. i so pissed off and my cat denis climbed onto desk and got scare by man hump chair and denis knocked over diet coke from mc donalds. i was so upset and sad. big mac was so yum got a few bites was tasty. then just when my life couldnt get worse while playing this game  one of my friends friend pete came in with his big mac he threw it at me. but the throw didnt hit me it hit monitor causing monitor to fall and break my fingers. my nan saw i was playing this she was so mad so she dropkicked me into the wall and now family is mean to me because nana said it was my fault so now i am grounded. i then cried and got scare because denis drunk all diet coke from carpet he had heart attacked. i was crying so bad. but i ate big mac off floor it had dog hair in it but was  yum tasted like big mac. why do he scare and make drop big mac. why he do this to me and family. i wish my friend raheem didnt gift me this game he caused me so much pain. but at least big mac supported me at the end of day. this game broke me but i will still play it because everything deserves second chance but if man hump chair make me drop mc donalds again i will not play again. i hope creators of this game dont have good birthday what the put me through no one should ever go through.
"very disappointing compared to the original hd xyth

the balance is ridiculously easy, spend 20 hours grinding boring fights to complete the middle hoping to find a challenge there, but all i found was enemies with mixed decks, that cant even produce a ship a turn......disappointing
the only fight i lost in 20 hours was against some overpowered event where the enemy starts with 7 ships.....what 7?
went back there after first clear in the middle and cakewalked them too.......boringggggggg

love the flagship idea, but again ridiculous. 0 power to remove the blocker on turn 1? goodbye boss of EVERY FIGHT, what a joke

also in the old one, you would farm difficult long campaigns just to get a few elites and 1 legendairy.
which you had to do again and again so you could eventually merge multiple cards, to create a t2/3/4 better version
in which you could keep seeing your progress become smoother and easier.

while here its a cakewalk from the start and you get a full deck of all elites you would like within minutes....and you cant even merge them anymore, you basicly max out the perfect deck after 1 hour.....boringgggggggggggggggg

really recommend this game, but rather the version called hd xyth found on kongregate

"I used to get this product keep crashing on launch. But after I did so many research, turns out that there are a few things to note if you want to play this game.

1. Windows Update : You need Windows Update KB2670838 (download from their official site)
2. DirectX has to be the latest (I used DirectX 11)
3. Turn off V-Sync and update your VGA Driver.
4. Make sure to own the recommended hardware / system
5. Free Spaces (drive) at least 4-5 GB
6. Verify the game through steam.

Now this is my recommendation if you want to have more immersive experience with this game.

1. Play Atelier Rorona and get True Endings
2. Play Atelier Totori and get True Endings
3. Play Atelier Meruru and get True Endings
4. Don't search for ""Guide"", just wing it.
5. Play in Normal for a while to adjust yourself, then change difficulty to the hardest difficulty once you are set.
6. Learn how to Multi task.
7. Synthesis the greatest Item possible.
8. Don't miss any task.
9. Watch out for the cuteness overload.

I enjoy this game, 10/10"
"Cloudlands is a game where all you really have to ask yourself is whether or not you like minigolf. The motion controls are pretty much perfect, and this is probably the closest you can get to actual minigolf without leaving your room. The courses are another matter entirely; some of them are pretty standard, like the usual 3 or 4 par traditional courses you'd see on a real mingolf course, but some of them are enormous sprawling 40+ par courses filled with ball cannons. rotating obstacles, half-pipe curves, and more that are really fun to play with a friend. It has both online and local multiplayer, with the local play involving each player playing the course and then passing the headset to the next player. It may not be the most exciting game on the Vive, but if you've got friends who are up for some minigolf you can get a pretty good time out of this."
"Best way to play Texas Holdem.  Probably the best way to learn how to play too!

Plenty of people playing at ALL hours of the night.
I watched two Japanese girls learn the game in 5 minutes!
If you're alone you'll play a robot and eventually somebody will join.
(its a good way to get more money than everybody else.)

If you own a VR headset and like Poker.   This is a no brainer.  You download it NOW..

I played a poker game in VR a looong time ago on DK2 and it used a controller.  I couldn't WAIT to play with motion controls.  And here we are.

I know those developers were from India and they were great and smart people.  If this is them...  they have a bright future.

I just wanna say my favorite time playing Texas Holdem was on Red Dead Redemption.  I was playing in a gazzebo at night in a thunderstorm!   I WISH for more atmospheric stuff like that.  I think it'd be a good way to generate revenue.  Different locations that we can purchase.   Let us play on a slab of rock on the edge of a cliff like cavemen for all I care.  Anything.  Steam workshop would be amazing.

Don't get me wrong, this atmosphere is amazing.  There's a huge 120"" screen that I watch 90% of the time.  When it's your turn to play, the camera is ON YOU for everybody to witness.  It's like being on camera at a Fox Sports UFC event.  (I usually sip my beer and everybody sees it.)

It's great fun looking like a MUPPET on the bigscreem.

10/10 man get this shit, even if you don't know how to play.  I think a Chart that shows which hands win would be nice.
ALSO you can see ""Straight"" or whatever you possess right on the table..  I just WISH when someone wins a match it says on the bigscreen whether it was a STRAIGHT or a ROYAL FLUSH.   I WANT TO SEE IT!!!  (i want that more than new locations.)  Because you have to sit there and analyse it wondering how they beat you.

Adding more characters would be good.

THanks devs.  THis could be an amazing $20 game but nobody would be online.   People are online all the time.  Thank you."

"As the description says, a down-to-the-essentials ""mini-Metroidvania"" designed to be completed in one or two sittings; while the price tag might be a turnoff for those not interested in replaying the game to improve their speedrunning times, what is here is quite pleasant. The pixel visuals are attractive, the controls feel good, and while the map is a bit vague it should generally give you some idea of where to go next; even if you only plan on a single playthrough it's easily worth a pickup when on sale. Hopefully we'll get the chance to see what this developer can do on a larger-scale project; I'll certainly be looking forward to it, if the fates allow."
I say you add a multiplayer part to the game. Like a never ending swarm you and your team has to defeat and play with friends. Who think's it's a good idea.
"Solid platformer metroidvania game, for the most part the level design is pretty clever and gets a lot out of the minimal control scheme. Biggest gripe I have is that double tap dash is always, alwyas a bad mechanic and having the option to switch to a button for a dash would be much preferred. Also think a lot of the chaser fireball sections aren't great. But besides that it's all good stuff, definitely gets pretty challenging near the end but rarely feels unfair and the bonus level as well is challenging but mostly pretty reasonable and not too long either. It's a good length for the kind of game this is. Visually it's okay, not great but serviceable, and the soundtrack's pretty solid too. All in all probably worth the asking price and worth playng if you want a quick but satisfying platforming challenge."

[i] Note: received this game free as part of the Steam Curator program [/i]

I'm honestly surprised that this game has no negative reviews yet. The only reason I'm not giving this a negative review is because of the price point. For $10 I don't expect much and this game delivered around those expectations. However, had this game been offered at $20, I would have definitely given it a negative review. There's just not much to this game. Once you get over the teleporting ""slow time"" mechanic and stealing guns, there's not much meat to the bone.

Currently, you only play 1 character. A dual wielding gun expert of sorts. There's 4 types of handguns you can purchase and upgrade. However, you can steal enemy guns when you teleport to them. Therein lies one of the problems in the game, you can't always control when you don't want to steal a gun. Don't want a shotgun because you need to kill an enemy far away? Too bad. Often, I found myself with double shotguns which is useless. 

But don't worry. You can just hide behind some corner and enemies will come straight to you. They just spawn from nowhere and then teleport to where you are. The enemy AI doesn't seem especially intelligent. After 1.3 hours of playtime, I didn't come close to dying besides the time I had to walk away for a moment.

There seems to be limited mission types. It's either defend a point or kill waves (after 1.3 hours, who knows maybe they spiced up the game after). There's very little story and each level is just a set piece with a limited area you can traverse. This game does have full locomotion so that's neat. But the problem is that you walk pretty slowly and there's multiple areas you can't cross. You can only teleport to pink areas or within defend zones / killed enemies. You can't teleport just anywhere. In any event, you can easily just hide behind some cover and just wait in the area you're supposed to defend. Most of the time you don't even have to kill enemies. For one mission, I spent almost 3 minutes just standing and doing nothing. That's not good game design. Why all the positive reviews?

Don't get me wrong. This game has moments where it's a lot fo fun. But it's also filled with very boring level areas and gameplay elements. Sure you feel like a superhero when you kill enemies and teleport and steal their guns, but it seems that's all you can do. This game isn't as rich in its gameplay as you would think from reading the reviews or looking at the store page. The level environmental designs also look very similar to one another. There's not a lot of variety in the visuals. In fact, you backtrack to previous missions for a wave mode. 

However, it's only $10. I didn't expect much. Just know what you're getting, don't believe the hype. It's still in EA, so there's a chance this game could be much better in the future. But given the current game design, that's doubtful to me. Lastly, I did experience a curious bug. There seemed to be a lag at times where I shot enemies and nothing happened to them. This happened on several occassions.

Rate 6/10."
"An unique approach to RPG (and/or adventure) genre, with even more unique atmosphere. Being Polish, I love those Russian fairy tales with words such as ""pierogi"", ""Koschei"" or... ""witcher"" ;-)

"Is this game in general fun? Yes. However...
I enjoy casual simulators and love flying, so when I saw this game with several cool light sport aircraft, I jumped at it. Goodness gracious did I want to fly a Gee Bee. Unfortunately after an hour and a half of grinding through the game, I am still far from my Gee Bee and my motivation to continue playing this game is wearing out. 
The run down is simple: start playing in an ultralight and go through some hoops and land here and there. Cool, I already know how to fly so I quickly got through the beginning tutorials. Now I want to fly something fun. Instead I am met with ""jobs"" that consist of pretty much the same thing as the tutorial; fly through some hoops and land here and there for money, then buy that airfield and do more over there. This cycle of buying airfields and doing much of the exact same thing is quite dreadful considering all I want to do is fly around in something fun. The second aircraft unlockable isn't even very fun to fly; a jet powered glider with severely limited fuel and the throttle cannot be controlled once the engine is engaged. 

I've found myself trying to run through these ""jobs"" as quick as possible just so I can unlock something that I actually want to fly, rather than what I HAVE to fly, and I've begun to think the payoff may not even be worth it as I'm already beginning to become burnt out from the repetitive gameplay and there is no promise I'll be unlocking a fun aircraft any time soon, and even when I do, will it actually be that fun to fly or will I have to continue grinding to the next aircraft?"
"Nice boulderdash style game. Loads of levels, most of which are fairly easy if you're familiar with boulderdash, but a few harder ones here and there so don't be afraid to skip levels and come back to them later.
For some reason the game graphics are always squashed, as though it was designed to run at 4:3 screen resolutions (you can see this in the screenshots as well)."
"I guess you could class this as a lite combo of Stardew Valley with the setting from RimWorld. Lots of focus on building relationships with your fellow colonists, any of which can be taken romantically or kept as good friends. Verdant is loaded with things to collect and craft, as you can change the exterior and interior look of your own house as well as expand it. You start out a simple farmer, but basically become a jack of all trades in an effort to grow the colony and attract new settlers to interact with. There might even be...aliens...

The soundtrack is amazing, it's weirdly sleep-inducing yet keeps you awake at the same time. No pressure to build or do things is nice, you just feel compelled to keep working. The graphical style seems odd from the store page, but Verdant Skies would be weird without it once you play for a bit. Essentially the entire game can be played using only your mouse, which is nice if you tend to game late in a full house like I do. Overall play time is probably around the 50 hour mark as although I earned all achievements I still have some collections to complete as well as secrets to unlock.

Few negatives from me, namely the two genetic splicing achievements which depend largely on luck from genome and seed sample drops along with lots of planning and prior splicing to earn both. Late game also feels a little dead, as at this point I'm just perfecting crop harvests and improving animal traits for the heck of it to spend a little more time in the world.

Easy recommend at full price, grabbing Verdant Skies at 75% off like I did is a crazy good buy,"
"A VR battle royal that does it right.

Pros:
The shooting feels pretty good and is better than a lot of VR shooting.

The game runs very very well on a moderate/low PC VR set up and flawless on mid to high specs which is a major plus!

Intuitive controls that are easy to pick up and feel great when you get a hold of them. climbing, flying and shooting feel so great together! The movement feels so good that it could be it's only VR title. I often have more fun climbing and flying around than actually getting in to fights. 

Cons:
Limited map and players. The map and player size is significantly smaller than a non-VR battle royal. This is to be expected but the areas are not diverse and buildings repeat enough to make the small map fairly uninteresting 

Quest users. The game is full of kids getting a quest for the first time and it's frustrating to get someone completely fresh to VR every 3 games. 

Building. I don't think building has a place in this game. I rarely see people actually using it let alone using it to battle. This felt like a Fortnite feature tacked on. 

Expensive. An issue with lots of VR games is that they are priced more than their worth. I don't think adding VR to a battle royal is groundbreaking enough to have that price, I have friends hesitant to buy this over VR games in the same price area.

Overall:
The game is fun I recommend it especially if you have some mates to play with. I will be playing more but I think it's too expensive.

"With nods to Earthbound and Classic Westerns, Boot Hill Heroes part 1 is a well-done entry in what could be a really good trilogy.

10 years ago, a hero averted disaster by bringing the leader of the Saint's Little  - the most ruthless gang in all of Bronco County - to justice....but that was 10 years ago. I mean what is that? A decade? That's a mighty long time. It's time enough for all the Saint's Little Gang to plan for their return. Chaos is brewing, and it's up to a new generation of heroes to put a stop to it. Will they succeed? Or is it going to be their last round-up? Well, since this is just the beginning, I'd hate to imagine they failed their quest before it even started.

Earthbound gets mentioned often when discussing this game, and for good reason. Both games share similar aspects such as perspective and enemies appearing on the map rather than at random. BHH also has some obvious call-backs, which can be found in Kickstart Creek, but we're getting a little ahead of ourselves here. Let's talk about the biggest difference, the battle-system.

This game uses an active battle-system. Each character (up to 4) can equip four vantages. These can consist of attacks, healing abilities, stances, and so on. Having the right combination of vantages for battle is a necessity. Attacking is more than just stabbing or shooting something until it falls over. You gotta figure out a strategy. Do you pick the enemy apart with a thousand cuts? Debilitate them with several status effects? Or save up for those powerful attacks? There isn't an ""item"" option in battle. You can't hand someone a sarsaparilla if their health is low. Either have someone equip a healing vantage, or make proper use of stances. Stances are the cheapest abilities, and for good reason. They put characters on the defensive, reducing or outright avoiding damage. There are many stances, some not even defensive at all.

Meter management is an essential tactic. Using abilities requires power, and it can take awhile to use the most devastating attacks. The same goes for the enemy. Even when you don't know their next move, you always know how long it'll take them to perform it. That's the key moment to go in any stances that you have. Not doing so is a fatal mistake. Still, death isn't quite the end in battle, your characters will recover given enough time, but they'll be worse off. Wounded party members tend to bleed out, become less resistant to status effects, and generally have a tougher time staying alive. If they accrue too many wounds, they're permanently out. Okay, I mean permanent as in: ""until they see a doctor"" but whatever. Basically, you have to go into battle with the mindset that anything you can do, the enemy can do as well. 

Like I said though, this is just the beginning of the trilogy. It only takes about 7 or 8 hours to reach the end of this chapter, and that's hardly enough time to get your boots wet. However, there are several battles that will require an understanding of how the west was won, and they're not the kind you can grind enough experience to breeze through. I expect battles in the next two entries to emphasize this unique and fun battle-system. 

Some other things I'll note:

-There are no clone NPCs. Usually with these 16-bit RPGs we see 20 dozen of the same townspeople everywhere. Not so with this game, everyone is different. 
-I'd be lying if I said that the music doesn't elevate this game. Jake ""virt"" Kaufman provides a great soundtrack. 
-Easy (and missable!) achievements. Pay attention to your surroundings. 

In short, Boot Hill Heroes is on the right track. Hopefully subsequent entries are even better, I'd hate to see such a promising start go to waste."
"Don't be fooled by the basic graphics. This is an excellent and nostalgic Flash RPG which parodies the likes of Final Fantasy games while also boasting some of the most satisfying RPG progression mechanics I've ever seen; an interesting cast of characters; and a surprisingly deep story. It also has excellent music, which—despite the MIDI soundfont—has been upgraded in this port to remove the original compression.

At least 40 hours of playtime for a fifth of the price of your typical full-length JRPG."
"Full disclosure: I purchased the original version of the game late 2013 and received a key for the Steam port as an early buyer.

You are Samantha (aka Sam), a lonely girl who recently lost her mother and lives with her father. They’re both trying to recover from this tragic event, but it has taken a toll on their relationship.
One not so ordinary day, Sam wakes up from a terrible nightmare and gets ready to go to school. She gets on the bus and arrives at the school building. But, something is off.
There is nobody inside. It looks like everybody disappeared. You meet Ethan, another student and suddenly, you’re attacked by a monster.
Where did it come from? Where did everybody go? And why you feel like somebody is watching your every move?

This is the beginning of the Darkblood Chronicles, an RPG game made with the RPG maker engine. But, it would be wrong to compare this game with most of the games made with this engine. The game visuals are one of the best I’ve ever encountered in an RPG game.
The characters are extremely well made, large animated sprites and very detailed. The environments are also excellent. You visit very different places through out the game. Among them are the school building, a monastery, a desert like place called War Zone, an apartment complex and an ancient temple dedicated to Ares, the God of War. 

The music is very atmospheric and it’s suitable with every scene of the game. When you are in Nova’s castle, you hear a soft, ambient music and when you are in the War Zone, you hear no sound at all. It expresses the desolation you see around you. The effects of the game are exceptional. The sound of the crackling fire, the opening of a heavy door, the sound when a blacksmith is forging a sword.

The gameplay is not very typical for this kind of game. The usual is that you fight enemies, equip weapons, armor, accessories and come across chests, puzzles to be solved and hidden secrets in most of the game areas. Enemy encounters are visible and once killed, they do not respawn.
But, you don’t have your every RPG game save game menu. Since you are a book worm and an avid pictomancer, early in the game, you find a book, and if you want to save your game, you open the book and you either save your game or you visit Ophelia’s domain. The depiction of Ophelia’s haven is amazing!
Sam has the ability to draw a picture and come to life! That will help you in fights, boost your stats in battle and as you evolve your drawing skills, “make” powerful objects, weapons and armor you and your companions use.
You can equip warrior souls you find that will help her boost her stats and give her temporary powers and skills you can use. Later in the game, you can enchant three of these souls, so you can have a permanent effect of their powers. You can also use monsters as familiars and become the fourth member of your party, so they will help you on your fights.

The game will take up to 20 hours of gameplay and it’s quite enjoyable. But, what makes Darkblood Chronicles a game worth playing? I would say the good story telling, the evolving characters, the high replayability (the game has 5 different endings), the difficulty level (it’s not an easy game, but it’s rewarding to play and to plan strategies to win some enemies). So, get ready to immerse to this wonderful dark adventure."
"If Capcom keeps rehashing the same series until the 12th iteration I'll keep giving my money to Inti, Gunvolt 3 is a refined platformer by people that know what they are doing, Copen feels more fun than Gunvolt and the freedom of movement that this character has is insane.

This game is amazing, i'm glad I bought it."
"I went on a whim and decided to get a 9-Game puzzle game pack that would be a fun idea to stream, this was one of the games.

This one didn't look too promising simply because it looked like flow on mobile, boy was I wrong, and I'm GLAD I was wrong. 

This game is genuinely fun to play, I was going through the list of games to play on stream, and I had to move on to the next game, but it was difficult to want to move on because of how enticing it was. Its so basic and simple, yet very addicting.

I'm not gonna try and attempt to explain how the game works, but the puzzle element is solid, you may be extremely confused at first, but once you realize the objective, it gets really fun and addicting.

I just recommend the game entirely 10/10 Its not bad whatsoever.

For the feedback part: Theres maybe like one typo?, I don't know what language the developers speak so I'm not sure if it was a simple typo or a language barrier, and I won't think much of it, but its worth mentioning ""just because"", but one thing I am a bit curious about is that when you fail a level, it restarts you from the very beginning of the puzzle, and memorizing which circles were assigned which colors when some of the colors weren't an issue makes it rather annoying to restart, so before you place your last color on a circle, MAKE SURE, its the correct move.

Also, I would like to suggest that when a circle is clicked for a color, the intersecting lines should be the colors of the circles the lines touch. So if I place red on a circle, it'd be nice to have the line be red so as to not confuse myself when I make wrong moves. It would also make restarting the puzzle I'm on feel like my fault instead of the confusing lines being confusing to follow. 

Once again, 10/10"
"Ok, this game is hard to figure out. Like really hard to figure out. Not going to lie here, it took me 4 seperate times of me telling myself I was going to figure this game out before I finally got it down. After that it takes some more time to figure everything out. Its really worth the effort though.

Once you start messing around with trading and setting up your freighter pilots the fact that this is a sandbox game gets more apparent. You can do the missions if you want or you can ignore them. Really just do what you want the story dosnt matter. I got maybe halfway through the main story and started building complexes to make more money so I could fly better fighters. Next thing i knew I had fleets of capital ships and cruisers and fighters. I was launching wings of fighters from my personal carrier instead of flying one myself. 

Dont let the age of this game fool you as there was a pretty big update maybe a year ago so obviously its still loved. It looks great, it plays great, and its hard in a good way."
"Pricey a bit for the quality. There is some issues with the UI (you have to scroll vertically and horizontally more than you wish); the english translation is not optimal also.

If you are a big fan of cognitive related tasks than this ""game"" is a good purchase...

The global leaderboard is worth looking into also; to get a feel about how other people are doing at different task..."
"Just gonna answer the question you are here for. 

No it is not pay to win!"
"The game just launched and boy, I was hyped!
I really do love it so far, but I might already have too many Koi... And there will be more...

It's only 2,39€ you really got nothing to lose.

Edit 3,8 h:
With a lot of teamwork, we did it, we completed our Koi book, there are no more pages left.
Is the game over? Not for me at least, not until I bred the biggest Koi of all time I'm almost at 4ft already.

Also it's 4 hours after release, and we had like 2 updates already. Now there are no more crashes, at least for me.

Edit 16,5h:
So my largest Koi is 1,2m and it feels like this is the limit. I bred all new koi colors, a ton of other languages are available...
It was a fun experience, I can still recommend the game. 
Dev really took care of the game before and even after launch."
"If you're looking for a hyper-realistic Madden killer with audibles, hot routes, and franchise mode at $15, this ain't it. But if the idea of 3D Tecmo Bowl interests you, then pick up this game. There's plenty of fun to be had across the three modes currently available, and on top of that, the users on the developer's Discord server have put together a compelling selection of custom rosters (NFL, SEC, Big Ten, PAC-12, etc.). In addition, the game's developer is very active in the Discord server, constantly responding to questions and feedback, and he keeps the updates coming at a decent pace. While it is an unpolished, early access product with some visual bugs to work out, this game is promising, with a distinctive style, and is worth its current asking price."
At least you don't have to build an apartment complex to win in Apex.
"You can joke all you want about the games self awareness and stuff, but hot damn this is a pretty nice experience. You can't really compare it to DDLC, its not a horror game. Its more an introspect into the consciousness of an entity itself. ""Is anything real? Are my actions predetermined? Am I being controlled? Am I alive? How would I react to all the answers for that?""

I expected to only play for a little bit at a time, slowly getting all of the endings over time and slowly piecing it all together what the devs wanted you to think and feel at the end, but I spent almost 3 hours on a demo piecing everything together and playing the same routes over and over again to see what would change, because things changed when I least expected them too. Its a nice feeling to have your expectations blown out of the water sometimes.

If anyone else is reading these reviews, the game is free. Go play it for yourself instead of spoiling yourself here. Its a really good experience.


hey guys welcome to eb games"
"Step in the shoes of Fang, a lazy young man who, through the miracle workings of destiny, becomes a fencer, charged with gathering furies and removing the seals of the Goddess, who has been at war with the Vile God for centuries, both of which are now sealed away in another world. 

Fairy Fencer F is a typical JRPG, that means there’s quite a bit of talk, and a bit of grind. It’s also a console port, and as such, it has some peculiarities. 

Fairy Fencer F is basically a turn-based RPG with beautiful anime-styled art. When you’re not dungeon-crawling, you have a view of static maps and Visual Novel styled conversations with other characters. When you are dungeon crawling you get those same anime characters in 3D view. You only see the party leader until you enter a battle, and you can only choose so many of your friends to battle with you. 
Battles are turn based, but not static. You can move freely around a predesigned circular area of reach (and sometimes enemies will be outside this area), which gives you a sense of freedom despite the limitation, something move-by-places or only-x-steps type of turn based games don’t give you. 

The sound and voices are very nice and very fitting to the whole anime/fantasy theme, and I’m particularly fond of the song used when you use “fairize”; it reminds me lots of the songs in Persona 3 and 4. By the way, did I mention you can choose between English and Japanese voices? Because you totally can. It had my heart right then and there.

Now, I’ll try to explain this as best I can. Basically you play as Fang, a Fencer, that is: a person who can wield Furies, which are weapons that contain fairies that add powers to the weapon/wielder. Your job is to go out and search for more furies - each one you get will grant you a new fairy. You can add these to your own weapon as “resonance” to make it stronger and give you some extra stats. The fairies you’re currently using gain experience along with you and level up. Fairies are also ranked - the rank is used to remove the seals (swords) on the Goddess/God. While the story tells you to remove the Goddesses’ seals, after the tutorial you can choose to remove the Vile God’s seals as well, which is a neat touch! Each seal removed successfully adds different boosts/stats to the fairy used to remove it, which in turn adds it to you if it’s the one you’re using as resonance. Fairies that aren’t currently being used in your weapons can be stabbed as their fury forms on the world map in order to provide various boosts, buffs and debuffs in the nearby dungeons (for instance, earn more exp, or gold, or drop rate… ). Since you can stab more than one fury into the ground, you can get quite a few boosts while on a single dungeon. 

You have combos for physical attacks which you can customize, and you can at a fly switch between three different ones while attacking by simply pressing one key instead of another, all comfortably close by. Because you have so many ways to affect stats and boosts, the system ends up being quite flexible and enjoyable to play with.
It’s a very interesting concept and I feel like I don’t do it justice explaining it thus briefly. 

Saving is done through specific spots while inside a dungeon, or at any time within the world/city maps. While in the city you get to speak with a lot of characters and take up quests that can give you some prizes and can also be repeated (indefinitely, as it seems). The quests are fairly typical, but quick to get done, and go along with what rank you are. You can also craft some items to help on your journey. There is some romance in this game.

Because this was a console port, the controls at first can be a bit awkward (for instance, you can’t use esc to exit menus, you must use backspace; you can use the mouse too, but it’s really more of a hassle than using only the keyboard); however, once I grew used to them they were actually very sensibly placed and quite comfortable to use. I ended up using just the keyboard all the time. 

I do wish the game was free-roaming rather than turn based, and the fights do get a tad repetitive after a while, making the fighting aspect of the game feel a tad like a grind. However, the story is nice and full of funny moments and the characters are cute and extremely likeable, all of them with their own personalities, doubts and insecurities.

The game really makes you want to collect all the fairies and remove the seals to see what will happen, keeping you hooked with the story. It also offers a New Game Plus + mode upon completion, which I always love but haven’t yet reached. Fairy Fencer F is a delightfully long game (with 30+ hours if you’re playing through just the main storyline, and over a 100 if you’re going for completion), but from what I’ve seen so far I’m confident in recommending this game to everyone who is into JRPGs."
"I think this game has potential to a really fun arcade shooter. There is definitely some initial fun from first couple of missions. Probably things that could change are the design choices for the different fighter types as they look virtually identical with only slight colour palette swaps. 

Another thing would be changing keybindings. Most of the controls are mapped to the mouse, which can make maneuvers such as 'rolling' fickle to execute. 

All in all, I believe that with some more content and some changes to the design, the game will be a fun experience that can get very positive feedback."
"If you enjoyed Swarmriders you are bound to enjoy this one, it adds extra classes to the game along with a few other goodies, but it comes down to the same fun, addictive and enjoyable twin stick shooter we loved from the original.

The controls are still pretty simple, a few rounds and you will have the basics down and your set to go.
As always the artwork, style and visuals of the game is really beautifully done, the game is a pleasure to look at. The game your getting for the price your getting it at makes this another must have game for your collection."
"I'm afraid to say that this game has many faults that creates a frustrating experience for many shmup veterans. I think the main problem i find with the game is that it is ""lifeless"" more or less.

Lets have a checklist to follow:

[b]- Very poor level design.[/b]

This is one of the biggest flaws in the game,. Stages in shmup's need to have a sense of flow about them. Waves, attack formations, enemy tactics, etc. SGS way of doing things is simply to stack as many things as it can that can shoot and spawn in from the top of the screen. The enemies that come towards you feel completely random despite being preset and there is little that breaks this monoity in all of the stages and it creates a frustrating event where 8 to 12 large enemies come at you with little connectivity to each other, some even stacking on top of each other.

It also doesn't help that each stage is set in space. Space is as entertaining in shmup's as what's placed around it and what is placed is either dull single planets or lots of rocks. There is a nice transistion of the background on stage 5 but it's very fleeting.

[b] - Bland boss design [/b]

This is a MAJOR flaw in any game of this genre. All of the bosses in the game are dull, boring boxes that do little to stop you. Most of the bosses have stupid amounts of health and take ages to grind down to dust. They rarely change their attack tactics in response to damage and most of the attack pattens are stupidly easy to dodge out of the way (the 2nd boss is laughable in this respect, as it has no response to the destruction of it's side guns.)

[b] - Spite design is lifeless. [/b]

Other than the player ship and one of the enemy ships, no other spite in the game has any real animations. They just fly at you and shoot. They are shaded colours and some of them are shaped nicely (The 5th stage boss has a nice look to it), but are as lifeless as a cardboard box. Bosses catch fire when low on health (random fire spites drawn over the body) and a few animated lasers but other than that the artwork is as flat as a ironing board.

[b]- Power up system is stupid [/b]

The power up system is wild, untamed and at the same time restrictive and in-organic. In each stage you can collect 1 of each of the power-ups (bullet power-up, sub-weapon power-up dependent on the ship you play as and rate of fire power-up), because of this you can't organicly collect more power ups than the stage number allows (You can collect more if you lost some, but you can't pass the limit set by the stage number). In addition, when you get hit there is a random chance that you will drop a power-up. You can recollect it after a delay but all of these power-ups fly upwards, but because every enemy ship in the game is constantly spawning (outside of bosses) you WILL get hit again by another enemy if you attempt to collect it. Btw.. it is possible to get hit multible times in quick sucession, with the possiability of dropping more than 1 power up.

The biggest problem with this is when fighting bosses. Some bosses are very large and will cover the screen.. and if you get hit that power-up will fly up into the boss's body. During boss battles, there is no way to gain new power-ups so if you lose any of your power-ups you started the boss with you then it will take a even longer grind to kill the boss.

[b] - Poor ship balance [/b]

Yea.. this is often a reason why in many shmup's they keep the playable number of ships to a low number. Some of the ships in this game are pretty useless. The one with the flamethrower for example has terrible usability outside of machoists. Some of the other ships will rip stages and bosses apart like there is no tomorrow. The mutli-sweaping laser ship is pretty much a I-win button in stages 90% of the time while the ship ""gold"" is pretty much overpowered to the extreme compared to the other ships.

[b] Final Thoughts [/b]

In all due repect, there are some things i like about the game. The life system is a nice conversion over the traditional lives system in most shmups, including the ability to slowly regain life by grazing enemy shots. The soundtrack was above average in most regards and hardcore mode brings true terror to the the audience that desires a good challenge.



In final, there is little i can recommend to a vet of the genre here that you can't find elsewhere on steam at roughly the same price (Reflex, Kamui, Crimson Clover). I do respect the devs making the game for chaity, it's just that the majority of the design is something from a run of the mill game from MS-DOS days.. and not the good ones sadly."
"Let's start with a sidenote, you can change the games language to english.

And now onto the actual review, i found this hidden gem during a sale and didn't even pay half a buck for it, so didn't really expect much, especially since i've had some major problems with the ""Games"", that uses either unity or RPG-maker, but instead i managed to find RPG-maker RPG, that's really enjoyable. 

Considering the game was first project and mostly written and done by a single person (There were artists to help out) it's amazing to find out how much thought and love has actually gone to said project. It's hands down one of the best rpgmaker-titles i have tried out, with obvious comparison in quality to To the Moon, it's not quite there, but hits close enough.

Storytelling and the multiple endings fits the game really well and are one of the best aspects. The further you delve the more you start to unravel the story. However, the current translation from chinese to english is really, really rough and could benefit from someone who does translations professionally.

That said, the game takes a good 4-8 hours to finish with all the endings, and for the price and the quality in details, it's actually a steal, if you can ignore the rough translation. I would dare to say you will enjoy the game if you've played and enjoyed beforementioned To the Moon for an example.

Highly recommended.

"I grab my rifle. One last day. I run to the sarge. One last fight. I board the huey and we take off to the island of chernarus.
We land, and slowly crawl out and lay in the drenched bushes from the last nights rain. Our objective is to take out the target, a war lord that is helping out the OP-FOR take over the island. We move up to a shaded, half destroyed barnhouse that was obviously bombed a few days ago. We run upstairs, and sit at the side of the window so we don't get spotted out by a sniper. The quiet is too much, no distant battle noises at all, no vehicular action whatsoever. Just the sound of the metal from our rifles resting against the shattered glass window frame. ""Delta-one, come in. We have spotted an enemy convoy heading to your position, possibility of the commander in one of the trucks, how copy? Over."" ""Good copy, over."" ""MEN, GO PUT YOURSELF AGAINST THOSE WINDOWS AND DEFEND THE HOUSE!"" The sarge yells. I sprint over to the right side window and rest my M4 against the smashed out window. A silhouette of a tank comes over the horizon of the road. ""Sarge, I see an armor coming over the horizon, over"" I say. ""Take cover and wait for my orders!"" The sergeant barks at us. The rest of us wait for a few minutes as the sarge keeps peeking over my window, wondering how we are going to evade/take this convoy out with one M136 Rocket Launcher.


The sergeant peeks over again. ""The convoy has stopped infront of the house, get ready boys, I think we have been spotted!"" ""АК Солдат! Перейти четкое наверху!"" A russian voice from downstairs yells. We all point our weapons at the stairs, and we see a shadow emitting on the wall appearing to be walking up the stairs. ""Get ready"" Sarge whispers. The russian soldiers head pops over the stairs, we all start shooting our rifles at him. ""ВРАГ пятнистый! --- Черт!"" The soldier yells, one bullet hits his head and a mist of red blood flys from his head as he drops to the ground. ""Dossy, go check the window!"" The sarge demands, I look out the window and see a russian soldier wielding an rpg in his hand pointing up at the window. The rpg turns into a fireball coming closer and closer, and the whole top floor is leveled by the explosion.

My eyes open, to see the sarge, and the rest of the squad dead around me. My legs are broken but that doesn't stop me. I equip my rifle, load a magazine, aim through the sights and put my sights on a russian soldiers. I shoot him in the chest and he drops, still alive, he pulls out his makarov and shoots my shoulder. My hands shaky, I fire a few more bullets in his direction before manages to get a shot on my head.

(Based on Multiplayer ACE Milsim I played.)"
""" Set aboard a high-tech space station in the year 2088, explore every detail of how the station’s crew lived and worked, finding the clues that add up to a gripping story of trust, fear, and resolve in the face of disaster.""

Seeing this statement, I thought that I would actually have to do investigation work to figure out what was going on and that I may see an interesting story in the progress, but I found none of that to be true.

You don't really ""find"" clues. You just go to the next area, listen to what the people say and decrypt what they were doing on their AR decides at the time. Rinse and repeat and you have Tacoma.

I was fairly excited to see a more developed and defined story as I had played Gone Home and I thought it was well planned, but it was lacking in a few areas. My expectation was to find that they had fixed those areas of that game and designed a new game with fresh ideas.

The story itself didn't even seem all that new. I've heard the same story in books and movies just with a lot more depth than I was offered with this game.

I like playing walking-simulators as long as they give me a gripping story with exploration to find important plot points. It just wasn't there. There was almost zero exploration as each of the ships corridors were completely linear with a living quarters tacked onto each one.

I wish that I would have liked this game, but from the first conversation that I heard, I got a bad feeling in my gut, that everything about story was going to bland. I played through it anyways hoping for some redeeming factors, but it never happened. Maybe if the ending would have pulled the story together and showed something great such as Amy working for the same company that owned the ship that I was exploring and then her turning her back on the company and exposing how they had caused the events that happened; then it possibly could have redeemed itself.

Even the main conflict for the entire plot was extremely basic and it left me thinking ""is that it?""

The rising action, climax, and falling action were almost non-existent.

And finally less than two hours to game completion while the price of the game is $19.99 is just outrageous. There is maybe 3 hours worth of gameplay total for people that are achievement hunting, but even then, there just isn't enough of anything to justify that price."
"I experienced some game changing bugs that really destroyed my gameplay. About 50% of the planets i could not even explore because my people just ran in to the corner of my ""spaceship"" and waited there. So if i sacrificed some turrets to take over a planet i could not even loot it. You can not even save the game. You have to play through the whole game in one sitting. Yes i know this is a very cheap game but if these things were fixed i would most definitely give this game a thumbs up."
"Somekind of an action VN, where a timer runs and you have to free all prisoners just in time ..."
"A bunch of us have encountered the same game-breaking bug halfway through (re checkpoint and falling apple), pinged support and gotten 0 response. So we can't finish the game. Unfortunately, it happens 4 hrs into the game so Steam won't refund you when you get that far.

It's a shame; otherwise I kinda liked how they emphasize narrative/character development, keeping the gameplay and mechanics easy and linear. Like a movie where you occasionally push the action forward. I'd characterize the genre as ""a walking simulator, but with bugs"" (crawling simulator?). It's my preferred style of game - others may or may not like that. The creep/scare factor of the many bugs also heightens the themes of alienation and bureaucracy. 

Hoping to hear back from the devs, but I don't expect to."
"Worth every penny I thought. Having flown in the R22 and R44  as a flying shepherd in real life I felt a real sense of being in the air again.
 More missions please,as they can all be completed in 4 hours once you get the hang of it.
the collective is difficult to get a hold of with the oculus  touch ,causing a few seconds of trying to grab it can create slight disorientation in the air.
 A wonderful helicopter  sim ,more missions and maybe more choppers,this game will be well recommended to friends."
"The game is so enjoyable. but not worth the price

If you can wait, i suggest you to wait for sales"
"To start off, Valkyria Chronicles is a great game! It's good to see Sega starting to take an interest in putting some of their former console exclusives on Steam.

STORY:

The game takes place in a fantasy version of World War 2 Europe. This is a pretty interesting setting, and one I think is vastly underused in RPGs in general. A brief synopsis is that a small neutral country called Gallia is invaded by The Empire (read: fantasy Germany) during the Empire's war with the Federation, and the game follows the experiences of a junior Gallian officer and his squad as they fight to ensure their country's freedom. Overall, the various characters are written in a way that is relatable and engaging, and the game avoids relying too much on stereotypical Anime character tropes. I particularly like the way the game handles the villains. The game takes the time to portray characters from the Empire- both leaders and common soldiers- as humans, with their own motiviations, flaws, and even some redeeming qualities, and it manages to do so without whitewashing the villainous acts they do.

This nuance in character portrayal is very important, as the game does not shy away from some of the awful stuff that happened in the real war. The game portrays both the pervasive racism and bigotry that characterized the countries involved in WW2, and it even touches on concentration camps and racial cleansing. The game mostly handles these topics with the amount of gravity and seriousness they deserve, and only rarely seems melodramatic or clumsy. However, the decision to cast the Japanese-looking 'Darcsen' as the game's stand-ins for the oppressed minorities of World War 2 Europe does have a few unfortunate implications vis-a-vis the victim complex that a certain real-world segment of Japanese society has about WW2. Overall, though, I'm still glad the game had the courage to address some of the more uncomfortable aspects of war, and I think its successes in this regard outweigh its failings.

Now, this IS still a JRPG, and some elements of the story and setting will seem hilariously out of place to you if you're not intimate with the genre. For starters, the magic rocks that power all Europan technology should clue you in that the game doesn't stick particularly close to history. The first half of the game mostly presents combat in a believable manner, but later story missions can't help but start to throw in some over-the-top Anime style bosses, and the introduction of a certain techno-magic later in the game's story might stretch suspension of disbelief for some.

GAMEPLAY:

The game is basically broken up into two different types of play: 'book mode' and battles. In book mode, the player basically just watches cutscenes that advance the story; each scene is fairly short, about 2-4 minutes, and there are about 10-12 scenes per chapter in the game. Each scene is self contained, and there is a mostly linear progression through the scenes, where you have to watch each scene to unlock the next one.

At least once per chapter, you will unlock a battle that must be completed sucessfully to advance the story. Each battle is basically a set-piece engagement where you deploy your units at a starting point on a map, and then take turns with the enemy until you meet your objectives (or lose, I guess, but the game isn't that hard in most cases). Each story mission can only be played once, but you will periodically unlock skirmish battles that can be played any number of times to farm experience and cash. Combat is basically like a turn-based strategy RPG, but there are a few major differences from other tactical JRPGs you may have played. 

First off, unlike most other RPGs where each unit you control gets to take one action per player turn, instead you get a set amount of ""command points"" every player turn, which you can then distribute to your units at will, to take actions, give buffs (called 'orders'), or call reinforcements. One 'action' consists of both a move and a shoot- the shoot can be taken at any time during movement. This is all fairly straightforward except for one major caveat: you can give more than one action to a given unit per turn! In fact, if you want, you can give ALL your action points to a single unit to move/shoot a whole bunch of times. Getting A-ranks on missions often requires pooling most of your actions on just a few units, to quickly penetrate deep behind enemy lines and achieve objectives.

This approach to combat is more realistic than average for JRPGs, but still, don't expect it to feel at all like a gritty war simulator like the Company of Heroes games. Cover matters- enemies will take potshots at you if you run around within their range, and enemies can't shoot you if you're behind a wall or a friendly tank (or even an enemy tank). Controlling your own tank feels suitably tanky- big, powerful, and slow as hell.  Actually shooting feels a little simplistic though. Basically, you take aim, then your unit empties their clip at your aimpoint, and then the guy you shot (if you hit him, and if he's still alive) gets a chance to return fire. Headshots are important, at least.

Secondly, while it's definitely an RPG and not a straight turn-based tactical game, the RPG elements take a backseat to the tactical ones. Levelling up your characters gives you some nice bonuses- it unlocks some secondary weapons and orders, character bonuses called 'potentials', and gives small increases to HP- but you can easily complete the game without any of the optional stuff, and the exp you earn in story missions will be sufficient to beat the game without grinding skirmish battles.

TECHNICAL:

This is a very good port. Keyboard controls can be remapped, the game can scale the in-battle/menu graphics to any resolution, and framerate is NOT locked. Unfortunately though, some of the cutscenes are prerendered at the 720p resolution of the PS3, and these cutscenes take up a lot of disk space- the game is a 20 GB install. The game is mostly alt+tab friendly, except when in combat- I sometimes have to start Task Manager to take focus away from the game then. The game is stable, but it sometimes doesn't shut down cleanly. I've never lost any save data that way, but it's a little annoying.

The artstyle is obviously very anime-eqsue, it's presented in a sort of washed-out cellshaded style. Maybe not everyone's favorite style, but at least it's unique and visually distinctive. I personally like it a lot! Also, the voiceacting is generally good. The Japanese voice actors are great, as are the English voiceactors for all the main characters. Some of the secondary characters can sound like they just phoned it in, though.

OVERALL: 8/10

PROS:
-Compelling and under-used setting for a JRPG
-Interesting story
-Good voiceacting
-Fun combat
-No grind necessary!
-Just as much challenge as you want- completing the game isn't hard, getting all A-ranks is!
-Great port- runs smoothly

CONS:
-Large install
-Some cutscenes are only 720p
-Some anime/jrpg cliches are present"
"Day 1: Arrived to colony, got beaten up, went to Old camp, told the guard I'm going to kill everyone here, got beaten up again.
Day 2: Refused to pay ""protection money"", some digger tried to beat me up so I hid in the barrel, nearly got beaten up again.
Day 4: Bought skirt in Sect camp, put on the skirt, got 3 joints of weed for free, increased my maximum mana by smoking weed.
Day 6: Met a drunk guy in New camp who offered me to sell his weed and split profit, sold weed kept the ore nuggets for myself.
Day 8: Went to old mine, lured the guard away from his chest, cleaned up the chest, nearly got beaten up, sold the guard key from his chest.
Day 10: Grilled 250 pieces of meat, put a guy to sleep with a spell, robbed his house, got beaten up again.
Day 11: Went into forest to collect mushrooms for the chef, got eaten by Shadowbeast.

10/10 Best game ever!

P.S. If you can't run it, stop complaining about it, use ""Guides"" section - there are plenty of suggested fixes, game works fine if your hands don't grow out of your ♥♥♥!"
"Save the Dodos is a highly addictive puzzle game where the aim on most levels is (surprise surprise) to save as many Dodos as you can. There are 4 worlds and each world has 25 levels in it to complete. Most of the time you are asked to save a set number of Dodos, though some levels will ask you collect fruit and store it away in a nest or simply survive for a certain amount of time whilst avoiding enemies and enviromental hazards. As you progress through the world's the enemies become tougher and more in numbers on some levels, but the game does a good job of never making you feel overwhelmed to the point of rage quitting. As with most good puzzle games you will spend ages looking at a puzzle and trying to figure out the solution, only to see it was staring you in the face all along. The art beautifully done and the soundtrack is one that you can happily listen too in the background without ever feeling the need to mute it. For anyone who likes the classic game Lemmings or if you just enjoy a good puzzle game then this game is a must play. Also at £1.99 the value for money is great :)"
"One of the best solitaire games on steam. A must buy for solitaire games fans. Great music, artstyle and casual relaxing gameplay. For the price it's going for, you just can't go wrong."
This game is basically a one huge love letter to both Hotline Miami and Akira/Ghost in The Shell fans.
"I'm definitely recommending ""Heart of Moon:  The Mask of Seasons.""  It's a nicely done Match 3 type of game with a totally optional level timer and plenty of levels (200).  The only gripes of any significance that I have are:

- The ""Flash"" Achievements is to finish a level in 30 seconds or less.  That's just way too short.
- The game gives us buildings that we're supposed to repair as we progress.  But, buildings routinely become available for repair while they're off-screen.  If they do that, there really should be some kind of notification.

I also have some entirely insignificant complaints:

- The font drops the left side of the cross bar on the letter ""t"".  So, after every level, we get to look at something that looks like ""Level Complere"" instead of ""Level Complete.""  There's also the occasional ""Vicrory"" instead of ""Victory.""  Note that the words aren't really misspelled.  They just look like it.
- When matches happen as a result of chain reactions, they don't form any special tiles.
- There's really no difficulty progression through the game.  The levels at the end aren't any more difficult than the ones at the beginning.

So, all my ""issues"" are trivial.  Plus, 16.5 hours of really good gameplay (with 100% Achievements) for a list price of about $6 is excellent.  Recommended."
"Do not expect drastic changes when you see ""Remastered"" label. Yes they have done quite a lot of works but remember this is a game from 2005 and originally released on PS2. Of course you can switch between HD and SD version by pressing F9.

I got a copy of Fahrenheit: Indigo Prophecy (GOG version, uncut and SD only) a long time ago and I'm so happy that it has been remastered, as well as released on Steam recently. The gameplay is story-oriented. Which means, if you're into fast-paced, high speed action or even sparkling RPGs, then this is not what you're looking for.

The best word to describe this game is ""interactive movie"". Everything you do may affect the storyline, which then leads to different endings. Even if you chose a ""wrong"" route, the game still refers to a conclusion (and yes you can restart from last checkpoint after all).

Pros:
+ Awesome story line, with different endings based on choices made by the player. No, it's not simple to describe the whole story within some paragraphs here.
+ Great voice actors.
+ Well-done remastered version with controller support, Mac+PC ports.
+ Uncut version (yeah, there're sex scenes in game).
+ Cheap (got this when it was 75% off on Nuuvem, about ~$1.89).

Cons:
+ Annoying quick-time events. They're based on PS2 control scheme. Beware: ASWD is your left controller analog and mouse is your right controller analog, use them wisely when you're playing guitar.
+ Dated graphics.
+ Random crashes during gameplay.

Overall rating: 8.5/10."
"I have been waiting for 5 years to play this game again for the achievement. Could I have just put my PC clock forward? Yes. Will anybody know I did it legit? No. But I know within myself, dammit."
"Oh goodness the feels! I will never forget you, Water Spirit!!!!
Hollowed is what I would describe as a little adventure, vague and foggy but left the best of memories.
My little spirits were like my best friends and they went through the entire journey with me so we kind of became a family, supporting each other whenever there's an obsticle!
I don't know how to write reviews but I woke up and decided to play this, and now that I'm done, I'm finding myself in a state of melancholy over having to say farewell to my spirits (especially my watery blue spirit!).
Overall, great game!
It's not too long, it's not too difficult and it's near perfect!
And the art, the visuals and the music! Yes please!!!!
I enjoyed it sooo much! ;u; Thank you for making this~"
"Fun game so far. Unlike a lot of idle games were you need to spend many hours before you can play it as an idle game this one is ready to go out of the box. The first play through is short, with out large walls and things put in just to make you spend money to get the first play through over.

Update: have now spent some time on the discord for this game and the developer is active and answers questions. This is very nice to see."
"This game is my childhood. You have no idea how much it is.
This game is amazing. Especially for back then! And it still holds it's ground, if you ask me.
Every line is voice acted, how many games actually have this? And back then, this was revolutionary.
This game has it all. Good music (I LOVE the ending and opening theme song, still listen to it occasionally) interesting story filled with a plethora of events, colorful characters, world and lore, funny dialogues, interesting environments, entertaining small easter-eggs and a variety of interesting different things you need to do that keep it diverse and intriguing. Even after all these years I know all the game's songs by heart. The ferryman song I sometimes randomly sing in my car when I am waiting to get on the ferry. xD
This game has given me so much joy. I have the original copies of the first and this one.
But when I realized they're on Steam, I just HAD to get them because I love them so much.
Funfrock brace yourself! I am now here to take you out on Steam as well, and I DON'T mean for pizza!"
they chose a very nice name for this game. But it's an interesting game.
Waiting for the sequel where Turnip Boy commits war crimes
"[h1]Introduction[/h1]
[b]Star Island[/b] is a short and sweet boss rush game with practically no plot or story surrounding this game. You’ll be tasked with defeating multiple bosses consecutively to earn a badge that presumably makes you more respected in this world or something. Even though there is little replay value after finishing the game once, the time that I played through [b]Star Island[/b] was an enjoyable one.

[h1]✔️Pros[/h1]
• Short and sweet boss rush game
• Cheap for the asking price, though not much content
• Can be slightly intense at times
• Bosses all have somewhat unique attack patterns that can be difficult to dodge at times
• Nice visual art style throughout the game 
• You’re given some maneuverability mechanics to help fighting against countless bosses

[h1]❌Cons[/h1]
• From the looks of it [b]Star Island[/b] looks like a reskin of all the [url=https://store.steampowered.com/search/?developer=MACKINN7]other developers games[/url] with some subtle differences
• Not much replay value after completing it once
• The visual effects are a bit too much at times, to the point where sometimes you don’t know what’s going on
• Constant sound of your weapon firing gets irritating quickly

[h1]💢Bugs[/h1]
• Pressing a button in the menu will also result in your character shooting or using a potion, whichever one you pressed
• The sound effect slider also adjusts the music volume at the same time

[h1]🕹Gameplay[/h1]
[h3][b]Boss Mania[/b][/h3]
[b]Star Island[/b] doesn’t waste your time with any sort of story or plot and just throws you in with the bare minimum amount of information required for you to get going. You’re able to change your character to have different starting stats before you go headfirst into battle and that’s all you can do to prepare.

The game revolves around mini-boss battles that you have to defeat consecutively without dying in order to win a badge with no real incentive to why you want this badge in the first place. These bosses are all somewhat unique with different attack patterns that never get complicated to learn but even though their attacks are simplistic, you have to pay attention to what sort of elemental attack it is. Some of them you can use the invulnerable frames of the dodge to avoid taking damage, whilst others you have to get completely out of the way to avoid taking damage.

Unfortunately, the game doesn’t get all that complex in general, half of the time you’ll be holding down the shoot button that constantly fires either left or right that has the range of the entire map and because it shoots so much you slowly move backward whenever you fire from your weapon. The other half is dodging the bosses attacks which can be brutal sometimes depending on how quickly they attack or their range. You’ll be given visual indicators to show you where the attack will be and what elemental attack it is. You’ll need to be quick with spamming the dodge button for some attack patterns.

Despite sounding rather dull, the game actually presents these boss battles to be slightly thrilling and exciting to defeat. Even though you can defeat these bosses within a few minutes, it can still feel slightly intense as sometimes you won’t be given much time to shoot the boss before having to concentrate on their attacks to avoid taking damage.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2218400665

[h3][b]Dodge, shoot, dodge, repeat[/b][/h3]
Your character has a small amount of maneuverability mechanics to help you fight against these bosses. One of the main mechanics that will help get you out of trouble is gaining a 3-second shield after either taking damage or using a potion. It helped out a lot, especially when you get to the harder bosses and their attacks start slightly stack on top of one another, without the shield you’d take constant damage so I really appreciate this mechanic. Apart from the shield, you also have a dodge that has invulnerable frames to avoid taking damage from specific types of attacks.

Stats also play a big part in [b]Star Island[/b] and even though it’s pretty bare-bones you still need to pay some sort of attention to it. Your attack, defense, life regen, luck and attack speed are all pretty basic, and even without trying you will easily be able to max them out quickly within the run which is particularly needed on the higher difficulties.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2218399139

[h1]🎧Music & Sound[/h1]
The soundtrack is simplistic and even though there isn’t much variety, there is enough to keep it interesting for me to leave it on. However, all the sound effects are drowned out by the sound of your weapon, and since you’ll be shooting a lot of the time, it gets extremely irritating quickly. Of course, there’s an option to turn off the sound effects but the [i]sound effect[/i] slider turns down the music as well.

[h1]🎨Graphics[/h1]
Visually the game looks fine for what it is, even though the same sort of colour palette is used for most of the levels there’s a small amount of variety which I appreciate and sometimes completely different backgrounds. However, the visual effects seem over the top to the point where sometimes it’s hard to understand whats going on. From your weapon firing to the boss using their attacks which can range from a simple massive explosion to a plane flying over and shooting constantly there’s just too many effects that clutter the screen.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2218399845

The bosses you come up against only really come in a handful of different shapes and sizes until they start reusing the same ones but with different colour schemes. It does seem a little lazy, but you have to appreciate the bigger boss battles that are a lot more unique and memorable than the smaller and less impactful ones.

[h1]💭Closing Thoughts[/h1]
Despite [b]Star Island[/b] being a relatively short game (and looking like a reskinned game from the developers’ other titles), for the asking price what do you expect? You might get an hour or two worth of entertainment but there’s not much else once you’ve completed the game for the first time. Even with the added difficulties, there isn’t much replay value but the game is definitely enjoyable for the hour or so you’ll be playing it.

"First of all: The physics of this game is very good. The FFB and the controls are very good. The VR implementation and the menu system is excellent. I wouldn't hesitate a second to recommend it, if it weren't for one GIGANTIC issue.

In VR (Steam VR mode), it's literally so bright it's hurting my eyes after just a few minutes of driving. Like walking out into strong sunlight when you've been in a dark room. If I play for more than ten minutes, my eyes are still hurting a long while after I stop playing. I have to squint to be able write this review, since I just finished a session. There is no way to tweak the brightness level.

According to various forum posts, this is a known issue since at least April 2020, possibly before that. The fact that it still hasn't been addressed a year later is unfortunately a deal breaker for me. Yes, physics updates are all well and good, but despite an otherwise good implementation the brightness issue makes the game almost unplayable. I realize that there might not be many VR players out there, but if they can't prioritize making the game not hurting your eyesight, then they might just as well disable the VR mode entirely."

"I wouldn't call TO THE TOP climbing game. It is awesome, very fast-paced platformer, though. Controls are very intuitive and gameplay is fluid. It takes only a short while before you feel the flow and wind in your hair. Definitely recommended."
Easily the best wrestling game on Steam right now.
"I've never read anything like this.

Seabed is a VN that ends up feeling like a dream. It's hard to tell what is real or not because a lot of things don't really make sense, and it's hard to make sense of it even when everything ends. Every chapter has an insane amount of descriptive detail, and the story has a comforting repetition to it. Some segments can be frustratingly longwinded, but at its best it's like wrapping yourself in a warm blanket on a cold morning.

I don't recommend this VN to everyone, but if you can handle not much happening and all of the meticulous detail I would say give it a shot."

"This game feels really nostalgic, kinda like a timemachine going back to your childhood. Its a very beatiful game."
"[h1]The real wololo is back[/h1]

I’ll start my review saying that this game doesn’t deserve all the negativity is getting. People love the [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IgAVQdHJQ4]wololo meme,[/url] and also love to bash the first Age of Empires. The biggest characteristic of the Age of Empires series is that every game is unique in its own way. If you’re expecting a similar game as AoE 2 you’ll be disappointed, but if you keep an open mind, you’ll find a lot of enjoyment. Now to the actual review:

[h1]Remastering the game that started it all[/h1]

Despite the great reworked graphics, this game is more of a remaster than a remake. This means that it’s very faithful to the original game, including its oldschool clunkyness. But still, the Forgotten Empires developers have added some great quality of life features, like farm reseeding, tech queues, indicator of how many idle villagers you have, walkable farms, higher population cap and other minor additions. It’s also worth mentioning that the AI has greatly improved compared to the original and compared to the Microsoft Store launch last year. These AI improvements, made primarily to add more spice to skmirmish matches, have a side-effect of making some campaign levels unfairly hard. The game also features a reworked soundtrack, recorded with an orchestra. Personally, [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1846861089]I don’t like it too much[/url], as the composer in charge have changed several melodies here and there, killing the nostalgic mood – imagine if someone re-recorded the classic [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bTpp8PQSog]Indiana Jones[/url] theme, starting fine and changing some notes in the way: that’s how it feels to me. 

[h1]What if I don’t want all this fanciness?[/h1]

Then you can enable the [url=https://youtu.be/I_1S5OqAo4w?t=214]Classic Mode[/url] in custom games, which uses the original graphics, soundtrack and gameplay. This mode is very poorly implemented, though, for several reasons: 1) You can’t use it on the campaigns; 2) You can’t use it on multiplayer; 3) It starts with the vanilla soundtrack rather than the Rise of Rome soundtrack like it used to in the original with the expansion; 4) The interface is the same as the Definitive Edition, so it’s not totally nostalgic; 5) You can’t choose between the MIDI and the recorded soundtrack from the Gold Edition. I’m hoping these issues can be solved in a near future. And it would be good if we could choose to use the original sound effects outside Classic Mode, as some re-recorded sounds are truly awful. Yeah, they have changed the classic “[url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYdbcIQ-pQ4]Rogan?[/url]” sound to another “Rogan?” that sounds like it came from a drunk and high pitched voice actor. Unbelievable.
 
[h1]What sets AoE 1 apart compared with AoE 2[/h1]

If you never have played the first Age of Empires, you should know that a lot of strategies from Age of Empires II don’t work here. For starters, there’s no gate – I actually love this, because no one is ever safe, and you need to be creative with your walls placement, sometimes even creating some mazes that mashes with the environment. There’s also no land trading and no way to buy and sell resources on the market, so you need to plan a good strategy ahead as soon as you uncover the map. No army formations as well – it’s all brute and raw. There’s no scout at the start, so if you want to explore the map without hurting your progress (avoiding using your villagers to explore) you should advance to the second age (Tool Age) and train a scout – you could also use a Clubman, trained at the Barracks, but they’re too slow and don’t uncover a lot of the map. And the pathfinding is a lot simpler/poor (even if it’s slightly better in the Definitive Edition) compared to Age of Empires II, which to me it’s not a huge problem, as micromanaging units it’s one of the pillars of the RTS genre. Everything stated in this paragraph is what makes Age of Empires 1 my favorite in the series – it’s much less automated and comfortable than its successors, providing a more strategic experience.
 
[h1]It’s worth the full price?[/h1]

As much as I love the first Age of Empires, I’m not sure if I could recommend it at full price to everyone, as it’s a whole different beast compared to Age of Empires II and other more modern RTS games. However, if you have enjoyed the original and/or you are used to older games, go ahead and pick it up right now; if not, wait for a sale. As for the Definitive Edition features: they’re a hit or miss sometimes. It’s certainly not definitive as it should be, but I’m glad that we at least have it, considering that the first Age of Empires is a very underrated game, shadowed by Age of Empires II, Age of Mythology and even by Age of Empires III.

Finished this game single handedly
"A very relaxing and oneiric game. The atmosphere is awesome and so is the gameplay, that sometimes gets tricky, but never frustrating. I simply love the music. It's a very good game, and with a very good price. Recommended to anyone who wants a relaxing experience."
"This game is fantastic.  Just fantastic.  I backed it full price years ago through crowdfunding, and I don't regret it.  If you like point and click adventure, smart ass humor, and savage moments - this game is worth the run through.  Excellent indie company right here that pumped out a sweet gem.  The animation is adorable, the setting is fun and whacky, and the music is great.  I wish there was a quick save button, but the game does let you save and exit when you have to.  I haven't seen a game like this in at least ten years.  It is my sincere hope they decide to do some more with this character.  Maybe even franchise him. 

I have to give this a positive review, it's just that special."
"This is bit of a mixed experience. If you can properly box then I’d recommend it; punching these NPCs could be real fun for you as it’s not like an arcade game where you are forced down to certain moves and combos. Totally fascinated by the art work of this game – reminds me of Ghosts of Tsushima (obviously far less refined, and expect that for all VR games). 

There’s a the lack of localization effort – not only do you not have English audio, but you have to tilt down to see the subtitle and health bar, and they are essential for the experience - there seems to be some sort of narrative embedded underneath.

Right now, it’s downgraded to an exercise game but you can already feel there’s more promise than what’s already reflected."
"Pool Panic is the best Billiards Simulator out there. Here's why:

[list]
    [*]Hundreds of tables. Other sims just have a green rectangle for a table. Pool Panic has castles, mouse holes, biker gangs, campfires and more as playable tables
    [*]Diverse balls. Other sims have one ball that is copy-pasted and palette-swapped. Not Pool Panic! Pool Panic has dozens of unique ball types, with a diverse range of personalities and facial expressions.
    [*]Sprawling world map. Other sims don't let you leave the table, but in Pool Panic you can go camping, explore the suburban neighborhoods, go to church, jail and more
    [*]Unique puzzles and objectives. Other sims often have a very small set of puzzles: ""hit this ball into the hole"" and sometimes ""don't hit this ball into the hole"". Pool Panic lets you raise the dead, harvest wheat, ride horses, go fishing and more! Far more than any other Billiards sim could aspire to be.
[/list]

Pool Panic has raised the bar for Billiards sims. If you like games about playing pool, this is the best one available on the market."
"I've started nicknaming Remyadry ""Auto-battle the RPG"". Interactivity in the encounters is fairly low in so far that you can't give your characters direct combat orders. They may or may not use the special abilities you've assigned to them depending on luck and a cooldown system. The only inputs you can make are whether to flee or keep fighting between rounds and which of the three rows of enemies should be targeted. Later on, the strategic value rises a little when you can switch in reserve characters that you've class-linked with specific members of your team.
Most of your success depends on your out-of-dungeon preparation: Your team must be sensibly balanced, filling the right roles and you need to craft new equipment before what you're using becomes too outdated. The development of your skill trees, how you spend your money and the assigning of your POT-points will have the biggest impact on your survival.
Overall, all the monster hunting and loot collecting of Remyadry was pretty fun to me. I would have liked it even better if there were more unique monsters instead of the unbelievable amount of pallete-swaps. More could have also been done for its endgame: When I had collected enough skillpoints to get what I thought the most valuable, I had very little reason to adjust afterwards.
Remyadry is definitely an interesting and motivating approach to dungeoneering, but it's not quite as clever as many other Touhou RPGs that I've played, on Steam and outside of it. There's a certain ""junkfoodiness"" to it. The story and the conversations are pretty funny, though."
Who is Fusaishi Haruaki?
"This is a fun game when I can find people online to play with. Alot of times when I try to find a match no one is online, but hopefully this will change as more people buy the game.

It has a unique movement system where you move forward in small increments while pressing the touchpad, which I prefer over VR games where you move forward continuously.

It's fun to dig around and find all the different weapons, theres lots of fun ones including a frying pan than deflects bullets. I also love how if you can get close to someone you can grab their weapon out of their hand and shoot them with it.

This game is lots of fun and is definitely worth it, especially since the price for it is so low compared to other VR games."
"The company that makes this sells the 18+ content (as a ""non-Steam patch"") for an extra $10. [strike]This would normally not make a difference to me BUT this prevents those who do not purchase the extra content from getting all the achievements. Only 2 are attainable without this extra content. That is bullsh*t.[/strike] [b] SEE EDIT [/b]

The 18+ content consists of two scenes of two positions each. About 5 spots on the CG gallery. Not even worth the extra $10.


[b] EDIT 6/30/2017:[/b] Looks the devs pushed a silent update: I've recieved proof that it's possible to obtain all the achievements without the 18+ patch. However, I still stand by my original opinion that patch isn't worth the $10....just do a Google search if you want your jollies."
"I'm not asking for much.

Keys to turn.  Levers to pull.  Boxes to open. Hidden compartments to find.  Weird things to stick into other things.  Some recipes you just shouldn't mess with, and to their credit they mostly don't. 

If you've played its predecessor, not to mention one of the many Rooms, then you already know exactly what you're in for: solving extremely hands-on mechanical puzzles.  Yeah, for better or worse they're not breaking much new ground; but then again, why should they?

I mean, when they hit with this formula, they really hit.

There's this one puzzle, just to give you an example, where you work your way through an entire miniature town, each building a separate piece of one complex interconnected mechanism. There are a couple of standouts like that, and they really epitomize what makes these sorts of games so great.   

Even when you're standing still, they seem to convey a sense of tactile exploration.  You can almost feel yourself running your hands over each device, hunting for the next key to open up some new hidden compartment.  They're fanciful, yet at the same time seem to carry a real weight as they unfold like the grand complications of some intricate pocketwatch.  

That's when they hit, though.  

When they miss, they revert to being a plain old chore like any other game. Maybe it's weird to say that a puzzle feels out of place in a puzzle game, but you can tell the difference between the good ones and the ones that are only there as obstacles to fill up space, and there are definitely a few too many of those.

And when they really miss, well, that's when you find yourself stuck, scouring every available surface for the microscopic hidden switch that you didn't see because, come on, you can't notice every tiny little thing like that all the time. Get serious. 

That's usually when I found myself fleeing to the hint system, and it almost always turned out to be the same thing. Maybe I'm just bitter because it makes you feel pretty dumb in hindsight; but on the other hand it does represent a real failure of communication. Games like this establish their own feel where you learn the sort of things that are reasonable to expect.  There should be a palpable flow to them, and that's what gets broken here more often than it should, considering the amount of time they've had to refine this style.

So you see, it's really their fault when I screw up!

I've also come to the conclusion that puzzle games like this are just too slow to support fast-paced drama.  They try to spice things up with some extra action, but the tense dialogue and breathless chase scenes clash with the pensive, deliberate atmosphere that the puzzles themselves create. You could see this already starting to develop in the first game, and now they've really taken it too far. 

I'll give them credit for trying something a little different there, but I mostly just found myself wishing they'd cut it out so I could get back to turning cranks or whatever.

Ok, game, you've had your experimental phase. Now it's time to get back to business. Stop messing with a good thing. 

I mean, I appreciate all your effort, but from now on please just hand me my weird machines and step away.

"It's a fun game overall. I bought it because I used to play this and a bunch of other lego games on console when I was younger. Now, let's get to the problem with the game. I played through the story with some bugs and glitches that made me have to restart the level. I didn't really care then because I just wanted to complete the story at the time. But now when I try to play through all of the maps again in Free Play to get 100% it crashes a lot. It's all about luck if it's going to crash or not. This is sad because it's a really fun game even now when I'm older. All of the lego games are. I don't know if it's all about nostalgia or if it's acctually fun but I enjoy it. But these bugs and glitches removes all the fun with it... That's why I don't advice anyone to buy it. I would advice buying the newer lego games instead because they don't include as much problems."
"A masterpiece by wargames God Gary Grigsby! The best strategic/operational wargame for weastern front!
Regimental/divisional scale, scale to single pilot for air war, everything for years 1943-1945 in a human time scale (weekly, so 108 turns for full campaign), with a fully realitic game system in spite of long weekly turn.

(I played it for minimum 200 hours before steam release)

PS
if you don't know what I mean speaking about ""wargames"": this is https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wargaming
War in the west is a game of military simulation, not just a PC strategic game, before getting playing who buy it has to read the handbook (around 30 pages) to understand how getting to play.
If you know the more popular strategic Hearts of Iron games, War in the west is a simulation game, Hearts of Iron is just a strategic game, so WITW does not compare with HOI, they are totally different.
When I want to have just fun I play HOI, when I want to do wargaming (almost all my gaming time) I play WITW or wargames alike."

A very well done tower defense game. The WW1 vibe and the whole forties era board game presentationgives a fine impression and the controls are smooth. Content wise there is a good few camaigns and maps as well as different unit types. Sadly there are not many ugrades, but enough to make the game challenging. 

Where toy soldiers stands out is the ability to take direct control of units. This includes not only your gun turrets, but also vehicles such as tanks and aircraft. A nice addition for sure, but at the same time somewhat of a gripe - if your going for a 100% score you will need to take direct control - you can't sit back and just play as a traditonal TD game relying on your turret strategy.

However overall the game is great fun, and offers a lot of content for little money!"
"1.2 hour in, and loving it so far! Been trading off VR/PC spots with my girlfriend, and we're both impressed. The puzzles are creative, interesting, and tough. Great design by the developers, requiring that both players communicate and work together to move forward. Looking forward to the next levels! Thumbs: UP!"
"Obviously (like the description also states) this game is heavily inspired by The Thing.. hell we even get to look at ID cards with the surname being Carpenter ;)
The inspiration it draws from it is definately a good thing.. The setting is pretty original for a horror game... There are no cheap jumpscares, but the atmosphere is definately haunting..you never know when some frostman/woman lurks around the corner plus the fact that you have to survive minding your body heat tempature adds to a Chilling experience.

I definately give this game a thumbs up! Even more so because it's completely free to play :)"
"Here are my first impressions as someone who has played nearly every single motocross title in gaming history...

Milestone has fixed the resolution issue with a hotfix
Bug: ""Skipping sessions causes unintentional skips later on""
Workaround: Use the ""Skip Time"" button instead of outright skipping


Verdict: Best motocross game to date, but still not the realism I'm looking for. Clutch, manual transmission, good ground physics, good-enough air physics, track deformation is pretty great. 
Essentially a much-improved version of it's predecessors. 


[b]Pros[/b]
[list]
[*]Scrubbing works well, takes practice
[*]Difficulty scales nicely, providing bonus payout for increased laps, heats, and AI difficulty
[*]AI COLLISION IS FIXED. You just kind of push AI out of the way. They can cause you to slide out if they get the inside line but you dont get insta knocked-off like in MXGP1&2
[*]No more stutter like in MXGP1&2
[*]Somewhat forgiving track boundaries
[*]Keybinding options other than RB being locked
[*]First person is good
[*]Very good bike customization
[*]Good AI, nothing award-worthy though
[*]Mud and rain feel pretty accurate and pose a fun challenge
[*]Track deformation works well, looks good, and varies based on dirt type
[*]2 Strokes
[/list]

[b]Cons[/b]
[list]
[*]Race start is poorly designed; it has no HUD and doesn't let you shift into gear until the gate drops
[*]Engine Sounds are still bad in my opinion
[*]Bike setup doesnt seem to make any difference (excluding gear ratio which does)
[*]Only 6 characters allowed on the back of your jersey
[*]Music is super generic dubstep all the time
[*]A lot of repeat tracks from the past, some good changes though
[*]Cant Rebind RB because its locked to ""Rewind/Push to Talk""...neither of which I plan on using.
[*]FPS capped at 120 
[*][strike]No supercross tracks, big dissapointment personally[/strike] added as DLC $5 for 1 track
[*]Still no multiplayer freeride
[*]Not very good graphics (disabling AA and Motion Blur helps)

"A cute prologue for the upcoming game A Space For The Unbound. The story about a young girl who loves to write and dive in her fantasy world, she shares her story with her friend, a high school boy, the only one who listens and enjoys her story. One day they were sitting in their 'hideout' as she read to him, struggling to end this story she's been writing for a while. The young girl asked her friend to use the 'red book' which will allow you to travel to another dimension and eliminate whatever is 'bothering' your soul. The game has a supernatural element but was done nicely, especially with the beautiful pixel art which takes you back to the classic point&click games style.

The controls are good, there is a tutorial on how to do everything which is a good step most of the games forget to add. I loved the soundtracks, fitting the gameplay and atmosphere nicely, I hope the full game will be the same as this little demo we have. 
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1990361430

Pros:
+Interesting story with a twist ending in this prologue.
+Good soundtracks.
+Good animation and character design.

I enjoyed the prologue so much and looking forward to playing the full game once it is out.

"Yeah....going to have to say as much as I LOVE dragons and everything about them...this game has a long as way to go. Even for the sale price, it is really not worth more then like $5 right now and that is being generous. The graphics are very...sub-par, the tutorial is pretty much missing and that combined with wacky controls and shitty graphics makes this a hard no for me. I was hoping for something along the lines of The I of the Dragon where you are a dragon who flies around and kills enemies and whatnot. Even this game does not rank up against that 2002 game. Hopefully the dev's really make something out of this and I can change my review. I would really love to as I don't like leaving bad reviews for games but with so many of the reviews for this game being positive I just had to add my voice to this one since I really don't understand how it got such good reviews. Please be forewarned with this one guys....I hope it gets better and will keep an eye on it but so far, it isn't worth all these positive reviews."
A neat little arcade shooter great for killing a bit of time and an easy perfect for your collection. Definitely worth it for just a buck!
"CGE has finally ported their highly popular and well received mobile digital board game translation of Galaxy Trucker to the PC. For those like me who have already been playing the mobile version for years, the PC version is a near exact translation. The only visual difference is the fact that the screen has been expanded to properly support landscape mode since the mobile version is locked into portrait mode. The platform CGE used for the PC port looks to be identical to the one they used for their other mobile to PC port, Through the Ages, since it offers the same single ability to tweak a single aspect of the screen resolution. That option is whether or not to run the game in full screen mode. Unfortunately, the release I played would not allow me to deselect the Fullscreen option so I had no choice but to play the game locked into full screen mode.

Since this is a direct port of an old game, I was slightly dismayed that CGE didn't improve the audio quality or sparkle up the animation effects for the PC release. Galaxy Trucker's graphic presentation pales in comparison to the Galaxy Trucker-inspired Space Run. At least CGE added support for Steam achievements instead of just their own internal game achievements in the mobile release, but no Steam trading cards from what I can tell.

As for the gameplay itself, if you played and enjoyed the mobile release and want to continue playing the game on your desktop PC or laptop, this is a no-brainer. The larger display of a desktop or laptop screen make spreading, sorting and selecting spaceship parts easier compared to the mobile version, especially due to using the laser precision of a mouse pointer instead of a big finger tapping on a small screen. Multiplayer is cross-platform providing a vibrant, established online community ready for a match. And since the Extended Edition contains all the IAP's that were released for the mobile version over the years, you get everything the game currently has to offer in a single package.

Ultimately, fans of the board game and mobile release will be satisfied with this competent, long-time-coming PC port. There are no surprises, but at least it runs flawlessly on minimal hardware specs. I had just as much fun playing it on PC that I do on mobile, as it's a good game regardless of the platform it runs on."
Funny point and click game with great story and funny ending. Really important that you click the correct answers or you dead... Reccommend this 10/10 if you like games like this : )
This game saved my marriage.

This came is fantasticly casual and entertaining. Want five minutes of fun, or five hours of fun? This game gives you both"
"[b]Sacra Terra: Angelic Night[/b] (IHOG)
[i]January, 2018 review[/i]

I originally played and reviewed this game in 2012.  I felt that Angelic Night was one of the best IHOG's I'd ever played at the time, and that feeling remains unchanged.

Options include separate sliders for Music, Sound Effects and Ambients, Resolution up to 1600x1200, Full screen, Wide screen and Custom/Windows cursor. You can choose from Casual or Expert mode once you've started the game and get through the skippable cutscene.  The tutorial is optional.

Gameplay is heavy on the adventure, but it's also HO-heavy.  You may visit a hidden object scene three or more times, but spaced well enough that it never feels tedious.  The hidden object scenes will have one new interactable item each time you visit it, and each time you find an item on your list, a new one will pop up to take its place (for a while).

There is NO misclick penalty.

The HINT button can be used not only in the HOS, but also to help you find your way.  Using the hint to get a direction does not disperse the charge.  You'll find yourself to-ing and fro-ing quite a lot, but the game is so lovely to look at that you may not mind ;)  I myself rarely get fed up with having to traverse everything by foot, but I'd have been lost 10 times over without the directional hint!

EDIT:  There is a non-interactive MAP, which is found in the journal.

Periodically you will find tokens, which - when placed in the appropriate scene - will net you a new useful item.  If ever you're stuck (and don't want to use a hint,) double-check your inventory to see if you have any tokens hiding in there.

There are no achievements in the game at the moment, either in-game or the Steam variety, but it does have trading cards.

[b]Collector's Edition Content:[/b]

[*]9 Wallpapers
[*]Strategy Guide
[*]42 ""Beyond"" (morphing) Objects
[*]Bonus Chapter
[/list]
The bonus chapter answers some questions, but also brings up several new ones.  As is usually the case with CE's, the bonus chapter is maybe an hour and a half long, but the quality is just as good as the rest of the game.

There's something compelling about the game... I think it's that the combination of graphics, story, gameplay and sounds are woven so nicely together that you just want to keep playing.  Definitely recommended to hidden object fans."
"I've always wanted to become a doctor, and this game fully prepared me. Not even kidding. I performed my first real life surgery yesterday. 

Kidney transplant. With a motherstuffing pencil. Ended up switching the man's kidneys with a fire extinguisher and a watch. 

We laughed it off at the end though, so everything is cool. He likes his new kidneys."
"A solid, entertaining sequel to Forgotten Hills: Mementoes – macabre, puzzle-centric adventure.

This series is like a more gruesome but less cerebral version of Rusty Lake games. In FH: Disillusion you get to visit quite a strange museum that includes several exhibitions of very questionable nature and very peculiar curators. As you go through it, you realize that not all as it seems here (as if you had any doubt to begin with), and later, it all turns into an insane, full-on violent rescue/escape mission.

Don’t wait for any kind of serious fleshed-out story with involved development. There’s a plot, of course, and it directly relates to the previous game, but it is largely secondary to all the puzzle-solving, and some things lead to others by, let’s say, VERY lose thread. The dialogues are simple and serve the purpose of moving you from one puzzle location to another, not much else. With all that said, it doesn’t really hinder enjoyment from the game, because puzzles and gothic, bizarre art is its selling point, and it is done well.

The puzzles are everything that you remember from FH: Mementoes or might have gleaned from the aforementioned Rusty Lake. Which is a variety of everything under the sun – locks, logical puzzles, numerical puzzles, memory games, fetch quests, environment manipulation and code-breaking – all connected by a symbolical chain, where you have to engage many puzzles at once, and then one would slowly lead to solving the other and so on. There isn’t Mystian difficulty here, but it is challenging enough to be an engaging endeavor, and there will be a few that would make you sit and think for a while. There’s also a very nifty mechanic introduced early on, which makes everything twice as entertaining - you get a camera that you can use to see “the other world” while in the rooms of a museum. Not only it adds a really neat visual layer to a game, but it is directly used in solving puzzles, which adds complexity even to those that are relatively simple. And in the end – there will be a twist the game will be hinting about during the first half.

The visuals here is another thing that draws a certain kind of player, and they are great. They are like Goya paintings made by a talented child. Very distorted images that don’t have polished look but rather seem unfinished or made by a slightly drunk artist. This dream-like, almost amateur quality to the art puts an unusual, sinister coating on everything around and suggests the actual talent involved in making everything look so organic, unique and really, really dark. It seems to be a trademark of the series by now.

FH: Disillusion delivers precisely what it’s promising you – puzzles on top of puzzles on top of puzzles in the increasingly oppressive (almost cartoonishly so) atmosphere. It’s not too heavy but just macabre enough to make it interesting. If you’re down for a horror-themed ride and enjoy solving a myriad of puzzles, this game will provide tons of entertainment in now seemingly “too sunny and happy” real world.
Who doesn’t need a dose of gore now and then?

"I was invested in this game when I started playing it, but after a while it got extremely cheesy and unaware of itself. Between all of the joke characters and the really corny ending, this game just really isn't all that good. There's so many more things that could have made it better. Like, why can't we as the player have more of a response than in those letters? Why is there basically no punishment for running out of money? Why is the main characters sanity shown liniarly instead of diegetically through the way he interacts with people? Why is there this unstoppable death cult? 

The worst thing about it is that the game says the goal isn't to save everyone, but just to 'make you think'. That kinda sounds like bullshit to me when the entire point of the game is to save everyone, and the game **punishes** you for not saving everyone, through both the gameplay and the achievements. If there were more to the game than just pressing dioluoge options, I could understand helping people not being the only point. 

This could have been a game that explores what happens to a man pushed to the edge, trying everything he can to fix everything and save everyone-- without caring for himself. It could have taken a realistic, mature, apropriate look at suicide. But instead, it feels like I'm playing a .exe game off of gamejolt. 

The worst thing is that this game had soooo much potential, but it feels like a joke after everything is said and done. If you want to play a game that takes a far better aproach to dealing with suicide, try missed messages., or Don't Take This Risk. Those games take suicide 100% seriously, this game just uses it."
"Again 60 Levels. Where the Creator get so many ideas for so many games & so many levels?  There are 15 Zup Games mostly have 60 levels. Thats CRAZY. Some really are still tricking, find out right way & then do it the right timing. If you know Zup & love it buy it. Zup 9 is great. 

BUY IT PLAY IT ENJOY IT :)

Good for Puzzles Fans & Achievements Hunters"
"Russia decides to bomb Poland... er, I mean one of its glorious soviet era secret cities built in Poland and the Western world doesn't take it lightly. NATO sends the whole army of four soldiers into the city and loses contact with them. Then they send another three - a Canadian, a Pole and a French. Sounds like a good mix for a shitty joke. 

Instead, as player finds out, it is a beginning of a sinister story set in a devastated city which has been abandoned by human beings... but strange creatures lurk in the shadows and player faces them constantly in turn based combat. With exception of the end game and some silly boss fights, the game offers a challenge and you will often count every bullet as they are hard to come by. The graphic and art design are amazing when it comes to surroundings, the creatures, however, are of mixed quality. During the gameplay there is a very atmospheric music which fits the mood perfectly, although one could wish for more tracks. 

Overall, the game is great if you enjoy gloomy settings and even more so if you are a fan of tactical games. For five euro it's a must-buy, so get it on Steam sales at least. Get it and play it!"
"DubWars is a casual/music/rhytm-based twinstick shooter with a cool soundtrack and tedious gameplay.

Pros:
+ Soundtrack is awesome if you are into electronic music.
+ Cool for few minutes to shoot projectiles in harmony with the soundtrack.

Cons:
- Gameplay variety is limited and tedious all around
- Backgrounds are awful, confusing players about projectiles and hinders reflexes
- Not enough content
- Controls are not fluid
- Balancing is bad overall. Visibility area is poorly conducted. Movement speed is dumb. Enemy placing is awful.
- No sound effects

2/10 Kudos to artists who delivered that cool soundtrack. Gameplaywise, it is bad and limited."
"[url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/32296668-Casual-Game-Reviews/]More reviews on our Curator Page[/url]

[h1]And many more here [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/33843777//] Fenol Baron Approves Curator Page[/url] [/h1]

The connection to the classic work of Mary Shelley is quite strong, which does not prevent the game “The Wanderer: Frankenstein’s Creature” to present the player with certain surprises. Yes, we find ourselves in the rough and scarred skin of the Monster thrown by its creator and doomed to constant wanderings among people who are afraid of his appearance. In fact, this is a narrative work (read, walk simulator) with a small number of very simple puzzles, with the ability to choose in some places (you need to go through the game several times to understand whether it really influences something). The duration of the first run of the game was almost 2 hours, even if they were very intense, which should be immediately warned, of course.

The game starts very slowly, the first chapters are a very meditative contemplation of the most beautiful landscapes, relationships in nature and a gradual progressive knowledge of oneself. There is something hypnotic about this, especially considering that the visual and music in the game are simply amazing and create an atmosphere of something incredible. The artistic performance in the game is extremely enthusiastic, which creates the feeling that the Monster’s consciousness, and with it the world of the game are constantly moving, evolving, acquiring some new colors and shades of sound. The further you plunge into the dark history of the unfortunate creature, the more difficult it is to break away from the narrative, the scenes from his endless journey are so felt and subtle. Rare touching moments do not leave indifferent, and the finale is felt especially sharply, worthily completing a fascinating story. Of course, as I wrote above, the game is very small in timing, but you can’t call it empty in any way. History is filled with warmth, horror, fear of its past and future, ascension to the heights and fall into the abyss of despair, and the breath of dark romanticism of the 19th century. A very worthy art work that requires careful attention, and in return will reward the player with unforgettable impressions."
"Overall, a very solid sequel to a good stealth game. Shards of Darkness feels like more of the same, which isn't bad. I was originally expecting a little more after Cyanide hyped this new game up so much, but I had a lot of fun playing through it. It's still the same oldschool stealth experience as the first game from 2014, and it still plays on its strenghts, most notably the incredibly open level design, giving you multiple approaches to each situation.
The skill system got a little refined, but overall I didn't really care so much for it. It caters to different playstyles, and if you happen to just use one for the entire game, 80% of the skilltree becomes obsolete after you have filled out the one you want after like Mission 2. So if you really want all of the skills value you realistically have to mix up your playstyle constantly, which could be very jarring.
The biggest change besides the very pretty Unreal 4 Engine is the change in the protagonists character. They kind of turned him into a goblin version of Deadpool, with lots of Fourth Wall breaking and constant references to popculture and videogames in general. It didn't grab me and made me cringe more than once, I guess it's up to if you're into this sort of humor. I personally would have rather had the pure sarcastic personality he had in the first game. Very minor quirk, but I thought it was worth noting as they make a big deal out of it (even gameoverscreens where Styx mocks you for dying)!

Just like Master of Shadows, I can recommend this game wholeheartedly to fans of oldschool 3d stealth games like Thief or early Splinter Cell games. It's a cool little budget title and I hope the ""Styx""-Series isn't over yet."
"Personally, I think this is the best title next to Lost Odyssey on the Xbox 360. And especially because of that reason I was stocked when I first found out it'd come to Steam.

Please disregard my playtime. I have beaten the game multiple times back on the 360 as well as the PC port which was free for a while within the Epic Games Launcher. 

To the game itself: It's a 2.5D sidescrolling shooting game with RPG elements. Graphics have been upgraded and look pretty decent to me."
"The game is cool and much better than the previous one. The best part of the game is the atmosphere, music+art+dialogs do a great job. I see that some people criticise the gameplay, but I would say that it is satisfying, yes, it`s pretty hard but playable, you will need max 3 tries to complete the hardest lvls. And it`s a perfect proportion between challenge and enjoyment. 
The driving and radiowaves give pleasure but become quite annoying at the end of the game. It will be great, if developers add some new music to radio.
The game has some interesting gameplay decisions and special emphasis is placed on cosiness and relaxation. It is not a game for action, explosions and COD lovers, the best way to play this game is to open a bottle of your favourite beer in the quiet evening and chill watching this noir story and listening to beautiful soundtracks.
Absolutely recommend!"
"There are many nights where I come home from work and just want to play something casual. A game that doesn't require full screen mode, sounds, or my full attention to play...allowing me to stop without enduring countdowns or a permanent death in game. A perfect fit while I watch/listen to a tv show that aired that night. Stopping gameplay here and there when something crazy goes down in the show.

Chef Solitatire: USA fits my needs perfectly. It is by far my favourite solitaire game/casual game on Steam at the moment. Not only is it visually appealing, but the story that goes with it is great too! It even has trading cards and achievements as well which is always a plus in my books.

The levels themselves are pretty straight forward. Some are easier than others. This game does have a star system where you try to obtain three stars per level. You don't have to get the full three to continue onto the next level but you do have to meet a certain quota of stars to open the next restaurant. If you enjoy casual games as I do, you won't mind doing levels over and over to get the perfect three star score. 

The $5 you spend on this game is well worth it. Plenty of gameplay, mini games, and twists on certain levels. Who would of thought trying to figure out what cards to use in order to get get bacon, grease, or other antics off your cards in order to use that row would actually be fun!! xD

Kudos to the husband/wife dev team from The Revills Games. Steve and Kylie, you two have created an outstanding game for us gamers who enjoy playing games in this genre. 

Casual gamers & friends, don't pass this title up. A++"
"I'm the owner of the board game and played many hours with it. So based on this I can tell that this digital game is great. There are some small bugs around (letter 'P' in chat, for example), but the theme is great in both the multiplayer and solo mode. I can recommend it to any board game owner who thinks about to buy this.
Negative part: very few people are online on multiplayer. If you ever manage to play, that is better than playing in solo. However if no one is online, then it is a bit hard to enjoy it."
cute i like bunnies and this game has bunnies everyone please go to itch and buy this game for more
"Remember a time when games were challenging, did not hold your hand and also has scores? 

Love this game and the price is a steal for the experience it creates. I had the chance to play a version of this in Indianapolis at a barcade a while back. My friends thought I left after they did not see me for a couple hours. This game takes skill, attainable skill that is very rewarding.

You will find yourself forgetting to breath and in a tense state often. The on screen effects are just as beautiful as the humor. 

Great for parties too. Having people take turns blowing up is just as much fun as watching people cuss up a storm trying to ""get over it"""
"This is the best Touhou shoot 'em up, puzzle-style, normal, or anything. It's easily my favorite of the bunch - I've played it plenty outside of Steam, and know what I'm getting into here. It rules.

The attack patterns are all really interesting, uniquely difficult, and the cheat items are satisfying to use. And while incredibly hard, it is possible to beat the entire game without using the cheat items. It's super fair, in its own weird, unfair way."
"I have been playing Wrong World for 13 hours as of right now, and I can say this is a very fun game, with some minor annoyances, Its a Survival game where you are likely to die and if you Die it destroys the world. But everything that you say ""this game is ok but I find ""X"" thing annoying"" is because you havent unlocked the next Teir. ""Ugg it takes for ever to Cut down trees or break Rocks"" once you unlock stuff you can knock down a whole forrest in the time it would take to cut down 3 trees. You dont like Farming? kill stuff. If you go around killing things you will get any items you need to advance, Dont like the Fighting? Then Explore, there are many secret area's to find if you look {Try under rocks or digging in the ground} Overall The things I want in the game is to upgrade the house more! and If I want to make a multi story house I have to do it in an obnoxious way and I dont want to do that haha. but so far I think this game is going great,"
"It's goofy, it's charming, and it doesn't overstay its welcome. Almost every level has an entertaining gimmick, and as soon as all of the humor has been extracted from that gimmick, it's tossed aside for another, which is *exactly* how it should be done. It lets each level stand on its own, and every gag ends on a high note, without being driven into the ground. Just a chill, silly game. Thumbs up!"
"Let's get this out of the way.  Near Death is an indie game and it is short.  It is *very* short.  I took my time, wandered about at the end, reloaded the ending a few times, toyed around Sutro station after campaign end and sat back and soaked in the menu imagery/soundtrack before I uninstalled.  The game is probably closer to 2 hours in length than 3.  

I still recommend it.

Why?  The engine runs well, the game experienced minimal glitching during the three hours I played it.  The game was serviceably attractive and brutally atmospheric.  It's not often that you encounter a survival horror title that doesn't revolve around aliens, or zombies, or monsters, or evil people.  Near Death pits one determined woman against the most dangerous and inhospitable place on Earth: night-cloaked, winter-ridden Antarctica.  The game has minor crafting, some minimal puzzling and solemly ominous script.  However, the star of the game is the intense environments, coupled with an almost frenetic need to regulate your body warmth.

Jaunts, however temporary, between structures in Sutro station become an all-out fight for survival.  Visibility declines.  Temperatures plummet and the wind gusts can easily move you/point you in different directions.  It is exceptionally easy to get lost or pointed in the wrong direction, where a short trek into the snowy wilderness means certain death.  Players must carefully ration batteries, kerosene and other equipment for maximum efficiency.  Light/rope poles become your greatest friends when caught outside during a blizzard.

I initially started the game on basic Easy mode to finish it one quick go-through (I didn't think dying would support the premise of the game).  However, after finishing the game in about an hour and 45 minutes with no deaths, I can honestly recommend that Normal difficulty would probably be a better fit for most.  With careful gameplay, deaths can still be avoided and the game would probably lengthen to 2 hours +.  The game provides a satisfying, if not exactly flamboyant ending and the Antarctic landscape offers a glorious surprise while you descend from your final fetch quest/mission.

The game isn't exceptionally complex.  It lacks a wide array of features.  It doesn't have a hyper advanced graphics engine or massive multiplayer longevity.  What the game *does* have are atmosphere and tension in spades.  You will struggle to keep cool as you stumble towards your destination, as your labored breathing and chilled feet continue to plod slowly forward in knife-like blizzard winds.  You will care for the protagonist and most of all, you will appreciate the opportunity to play a game where your task isn't to kill, maim or destroy but, instead to survive against mother nature, in the face of overwhelming odds.

Near Death can be had on sale for five dollars and for a 3 hour jaunt unlike anything you've likely ever experienced before...it's worth it.

Recommended.

"this game makes me sneeze out of my penis, in a good way. 10/10"
"A VR Version of the Classic Arcade Game 'Asteroids'
Pros
- $2 for this game is well worth it. It is very much like a $0.25 arcade machine, that is currently best enjoyed in, say, 15-20 minutes spurts.  Of course you can play as long as you like, but if you're looking for a epic space saga, you might want to try something else.
- The reflections off of the cockpits from the surrounding space is fantastic, and aids to the sense of motion.
- The pitch and yaw controls have a realistic feel to them (e.g., you can't turn and stop on a dime), and forces you to kind of predict your shots. Firing with 'your hands in the air like you just don't care' will likely leave you more frustrated.
- Having an asteroid pass right by your ship, and trying to keep track of it is very immersive.
- There is something cool when you have the boss ship (?) heading towards you, and after lining up the shot , you take it down.
- You have to grip the joystick in order to move your ship.  Nice touch of realism, but after 25 minutes of playing, my wimpy arm started to tire, and was not sure if I could take my raised arm and place it on my chari's arm rest, and still maintain control.

Cons
- Could use a 'reset view' option. I'm sitting in a rotating chair with wheels; on occassion I would shift in my chair, and then I would be a little off center while in the cockpit.
- While the controls are relatively straightfoward, a brief explanation of what they are would not hurt either.
- It seems you are stuck in one place, and rotating 360 degrees in all axes.  This works well from a gun turret perspective, but in thinking this was like Asteroids, I half expected some form of thrust control.  Not a bad thing, just not what I was expecting.
- I was expecting all asteroids to be coming form space, and heading towrds earth.  Sometimes, when looking at earth, it looks like some asteroids are being shot towards me from earth's surface.  Maybe the smaller asteroids are caught in earth's orbit, and are circling? (if so, being able to hunt them down would be cool).
- Some asteroids, when hit, have a very 2-D feel to them, and feel kind of 'meh' when you hit them (this is in comaprison to the great 3-D effect of an asteroids passing by your ship).
- If an asteroid gets past you and heads towards earth, there seems to be no consequence.  I guess if this game had a 'Missile Command' aspect to it, I might have an issue with it.  While having the earth as a constant background adds to the feeling of movement and tracking, it does feel weird that the earth is impervious to asteroid strikes.
- How does global scoring works?  The number 1 person (the developer, I presume) had a score of 1800.  After my 2nd try, I got a score of almost 4,000, but the global leader board had my original score of 810.

Overall, I am pleased with the purchase, despite my complaining above. I had fun with it."
Puzzles are really simple which is bad. Buy if you want a perfect chill art game
"Don't be fooled by my lack of hours; I used to play this game for what seems to me like hundreds of hours and you can't believe how happy I was to see that it's finally available on Steam. This is pretty much my favourite PC game of all time.
The graphics may seem outdated to some but I still think they're appealing. The characters are quirky and fun and the story is great: You play Twinsen, the hero of the planetoid Twinsun (which has two suns - clever, huh?) who defeated the evil Dr. FunFrock in the first game. Everything seems fine and dandy until the weather suddenly gets worse, your friend gets badly injured and even aliens land on your homeworld, so you better go grab your magic ball and tunic and prepare yourself for some more adventures.
You don't necessarily have to play the first game to completely understand this one - you'll get everything important by interacting with books, signs and busts - but it certainly helps to get into the right mood.
You may find the controls a little awkward at first, since it doesn't control like recent games. Forget about WASD. Anyway, I don't think this should be a problem, since it's pretty easy to get the hang onto the controls.

I highly recommend this game."
Works perfect on linux and gamepad! Nice game!
"If you're looking for a quick nut, this game is for you!"
"Got curious about this game and decided to try it out because I saw it had almost 200 mostly positive reviews but not a single one was in English.

First off, the English translation is good enough to play the game without issue but that being said I can't really recommend the game in it's current state because you're truly at the mercy of RNG in this game.

Whether you successfully finish a campaign or not is mostly dependent on whether or not you were lucky enough to chain together and keep alive enough healers and archers together without having a messy formation because those two classes are MANDATORY with how the game is currently balanced.

The other classes (there's 6 other classes or so) are pretty much useless with their current traits so if you want to win consistently, you're pretty much forced to reset runs until you're lucky enough to recruit a couple chains of archers and healers in the very first map or two.

Overall very novel mechanic with a lot of potential, but poorly executed and balanced. 

Hopefully in future updates it'll be better but for now I don't really recommend it unless you're fine with repeatedly resetting runs for the perfect start in order to progress."
"RPG Fighter League is an RPG Maker game with a very interesting twist. It is also a Fight Management Game where you recruit a team of fighters, and then go up the ranking in a series of tournament style fighting leagues. As you progress you also gather an increasing fan base, which then allows you to buy better gears and items.

There is also crafting in this game. Each fight drops crafting materials, which then allow you to craft useful stuffs. Another interesting aspect of this game is ""secrets"". There are many hidden details in this game that are not visible and you have to uncover them to gain ""secrets"". There will be rewards based on the number of secrets that you find.

Another interesting aspect of this game is the vendors (weapons, armor, items, accessories, etc). Many of the vendors are absent at the beginning of the game, and there are interesting quests that are needed to find them and bring them back to the fighting guild.

There are about 10+ different fighting leagues in the game, and most of them have unique features as well.  Some fighting leagues require you to activate switches, some are in ice-covered terrain where you slide along the surface, etc. It is these interesting features that make the different fights enjoyable and unique.

The best part of this game is that the developer is extremely helpful, and that the game is still in Early Access.  The developer is open to feedback and constantly put out patches to fix problems and improve on the game experience. He is still adding enhancement to the game and will doing so, based on consumers suggestions and requests. 

I highly recommend this game and feel that it is definitely worth the low price. It will give you many hours of enjoyment."
"OMG YES! A joy for the eyes and a joy for the soul.
Tested on Linux and it works perfectly, can play with just keyboard or kb + mouse,
runs also at 120Hz and it's the real deal: silly voices and breakable environment :)"
"So I beat the game with 22 dead and 14 saved, all in all this game is fucking amazing. I didn't know I could care for fictional characters (Besides DDLC) as much as I have clearly been proven wrong here. I hope more gets added to this game and more things get worked on in it. The art is fantastic the music is fantastic the game is fantastic the ending is fantastic, the conversations you have with the people is fantastic literally everything about this game is fantastic. Devs and publishers, you have a very positive future ahead. Keep on this path and keep doing amazing things."
"[quote]With satisfying puzzles, an interesting narrative and charming characters, Primordia is a wonderful experience for those looking for their next point and click adventure. Seldom frustrating, though perhaps a little brief, Primordia doesn’t outstay its welcome offering six to ten hours of enjoyable adventuring, and suitable for those new to the genre and the grizzled veterans seeking to satiate their addiction.[/quote]

I’ve redrafted the start of this review four or five times, each time scrubbing out the words I’d written as being inarticulate and not expressing what I’d like to say. And that’s because Primordia deserves to be lauded for what it is and does… for whilst a point and click adventure is a relatively easy thing to create (just ask any HyperCard enthusiast), a good point and click is not. Primordia is a good point and click adventure, and whilst it doesn’t top some of my experiences with the Lucasarts treasury, the fact that I’m placing it on that pedestal close to the classics should be some indication of its quality.

Primordia, despite its post-apocalyptic setting, doesn’t fall foul of some of the easy clichés that might so easily rear their heads. Its protagonist doesn’t really want to ruin his day with bothersome adventuring, isn’t hugely interested in the wider world around him, and, but for a lack of power, would happily remain at home. Sadly with events conspiring against him, Horatio and his robo side-kick Crispin are thrust on a journey which leads them to question their place in the world and the nature of their existence (well Horatio does, Crispin just wants arms).  Primordia’s narrative is thoughtful without spreading it too thickly, touching on deeper themes but devoid of the heavy handed storytelling that might mar just its philosophical musings. It’s not perfect, but it explores the ideas it presents in a way that is complimentary to the game, and not in a manner that’s jarringly incongruent to the experience.

Part of what assists this narrative is the presentation, going the Adventure Game Studio route and opting for low resolution, pixelated graphics. Whilst this necessitates windowed play (you can try to stretch the game out but I guarantee you’ll be back to a window within minutes) the game looks lovely when viewed appropriately, with genuine care taken in its appearance. Despite the inherent limitations, the characters are illustrated distinctly, their forms representing the different personalities that each has. What few cutscenes there are fail to disappoint, and but for those playing the game with subtitles, will find place in the screenshot galleries of many a player. The world could perhaps be described as drab, but how better to describe a ruined and decaying world?

But atmosphere is not created through visuals alone and it’s easy to forget the importance sound plays. The voice acting, whilst not necessarily stellar, is solid and Crispin’s quips are especially notable, providing notable light relief in a game that, at times, might become a little dour. Nathaniel Chambers’ soundtrack is integral to the experience, fitfully embodying the dark and oppressive or the sense of wonder and discovery that accompany the journey. If anything the soundtrack recalls Vangelis’ Blade Runner compositions, which whilst I would imagine is intended, nevertheless is high praise indeed – these soundscapes may not be individually memorable, but in conjunction with the world, they enhance the gameplay immeasurably.

Of course all this would be for naught if the puzzles were awful…point and click games live and die by this facet of their design. Thankfully Primordia adopts a very logical approach, with potentially real world solutions to the problems that Horatio and Crispin must overcome. What also must be commended is the limitation of inventory junk that might litter lesser games, with our protagonists’ options sensibly limited to prevent frustration or obtuse puzzle design. The puzzle areas aren’t tiny by any means, but are relatively compact and it’s nice that it’s rare to bump into arbitrary walls because an inconspicuous item might be missed. Furthermore, Crispin functions as an in-built hint system providing the player with titbits of help should they be stumped about what to do next. This is a fantastic idea, and something that should be a staple of point and clicks – allow the player the opportunity to progress naturally, but should they become stuck and want help give them the chance to seek it without resorting to a guide. 

Primordia isn’t faultless however, and there are occasional bumps in the experience. Once or twice it may be difficult to work out what to do next (and on one occasion Cripin’s advice was out of sequence, giving help with a puzzle that occurred after the current roadblock) and separating the right mouse button into a dedicated look did cause one moment of frustration. However, Primordia has all the elements that go towards making a game that’s enjoyable for everyone rather than just hardcore point and click purists, and it’s for that reason that it becomes an easy recommendation for those looking at games in this genre.

"What have they've done... It feels really weird with those horrible cut-scenes, simple dialogues, extremely repetitive and boring gameplay, and on top of that the plot is lacking of any interest, you are going to basically find clues everywhere until you get sick and abandon the game if you have better things to do. I also was expecting way more QTE and battles.
Shenmue 1 was amazing though, perhaps because I was a kid enjoying this kind of game for the first time, but after having played Yakuza and so many others, this one has nothing to do, even if you are a Shenmue fan."
"This game is a total classic and works great on Steam.  The hotseat multiplayer is an awesome way to enjoy the thrill of Worms combat with only one PC.  You can enjoy hotseat and online multiplayer with up to 6 people.  Great variety of weapons and infinite possibilities for fun with user created levels, soundpacks, and more.  It's fun at an entry level and there's a ton of depth to some of the mechanics (like the ninja rope) that gives the game even more replay value.  Highly recommended."
"This game lets you live out your perverted power fantasies like having a house, friends, and somewhat stable income."
"An artfully crafted boss rush game that has a unique style and feel.  Mechanically sound and a blast to play, Raindancer does a fantastic job of being challenging while remaining fair.  Ramp up the difficulty to Tempest mode for an even bigger challenge."
"I found this to be one of the strangest games I have encountered. It is basically a reflex and control game that offer no instructions. There is discovery, which is most of the game experience. Even with that, I still couldn't find myself liking the game.

Perhaps the experience that this game offers is not for me. Maybe I'll try it again someday but not anytime soon.

I give this game a ""Not my cup of coffee OUT OF 5""."
"[h1] In A Nutshell [/h1]

🔵 [b] Pros [/b]
+ Solid, enjoyable side-scrolling shooter gameplay, including some light RPG elements as well. 
+ Charming and clean hand-drawn art style.
+ Great variety of equipment, consumables and weapons to find, each with a distinct feel to them.
+ Good selection of enemies to face, ranging from mutants, to robots, to alien bandits.
+ Plenty of secrets to discover in each level, containing unique weapons and precious supplies.
+ Decent challenge level especially in late-game levels.

🔴 [b] Cons [/b]
- Occasional stuttering for no clear reason, making the game less enjoyable when it happens.
- Some bosses can be ""cheesed"" by shooting at them from certain locations without them being able to retaliate.


[b]Zombotron[/b] is a linear side-scrolling shooter-platform with also some RPG elements thrown into the mix, such as randomly generated weapons, currency, XP points, statistics like armor, HP, damage over time etc. [u]This combination of genres works, is solid, delivering a quality experience that results fun and engaging[/u] for the player throughout the game. Impersonating a stranded explorer captain, players need to make their way through the perils of an alien planet, and recover what was stolen from their ship.

This game has a lot of good points to it. [u]First and most significant, the well-made combination of shooter and platformer, with the addition of physics-based gore and environment elements[/u], actively used in several small ""puzzles"" to reach secrets, and as well the light RPG elements mentioned before. [u]Even if the levels are linear, so there is no backtracking like in Metroidvanias, they are filled with secrets which are very worthy taking time to find[/u], as they contain weapons, money to use in the sparsely-located shops, armor pieces and supplies. Players not looking for secrets and just rushing will have shortages of gear, currency and resources pretty often! Art style is very pleasant and clean, even if not extremely detailed. [u]Challenge ramps up considerably with certain bosses and in the later-game levels[/u], maintaining though a general medium level for most of the game.

The bad sides are much fewer. The [u]random stuttering is annoying but luckily happens quite rarely[/u], and disappears on level transition. The fact [u]some bosses can be cheesed[/u] should as well be fixed as it makes them too easy to beat. 

[u]Overall, [b]Zombotron[/b] is a solid game[/u], any fans of retro shooters such as Metal Slug for example, will surely find a lot of enjoyment in playing this game. Definitely a solid release for this genre this year, and [u]totally worth the proposed price for the 7-9 hours content amount it offers.[/u]

[h1] In-depth Feature Analysis [/h1]


🎮 [b] Gameplay [/b]
The gameplay of [b]Zombotron[/b] is divided into Exploration, Character Management and Combat

[u]Exploration[/u] of levels is pretty linear, without any coming back one a stage is cleared. There are several one-way drops to seclude a previous part of a zone, so exploring everything before them to find secrets is important. being careful to not destroy objects such as ropes, crates and other physics-based things is also paramount, as they are many times used to access otherwise unreachable areas containing secrets. Most secrets though lie behind destructible walls or hidden paths inside walls, less depend on physics objects. Vending machines are found seldom in stages, and accept currency found from enemies or by selling older gear.

[u]Character Management[/u] is mainly about leveling up one of three statistics (Strenght, influencing damage, Dexterity, influencing dodge chance and critical, vitality, influencing Maximum HP) when a new level is reached, managing the inventory to discard or sell excess loot or older weapons, and as well keeping the gear up-to-date by finding new, better rarity-level gear as the game progresses. Especially later in the game, players will need to be fairly conservative with ammo, else finding themselves completely out of it. 


📖 [b] Story [/b]
The storyline / lore are not especially deep or elaborate. Mainly, they consist of cut-scenes with text-based dialogues, outlining the unfolding of events as the story goes on. there are some lore pieces to find such as diaries in several levels, giving out a bit more lore about the whole situation of the planet. Do not expect any complicated plot or character evolution, as it's a simple, straightforward story. 

👊 [b] Combat System [/b]
Combat in Zombotron is made in a classic side-scrolling shooter fashion, using the mouse to aim around, equipping two weapons and a grenade type all at once, plus a variety of healing and buffing consumables stored in the inventory. During combat, it is possible to access the inventory while pausing the game, and use items at leisure. The pacing of combat is generally average, without being too fast or too slow. 

Precision hits such as headshots inflict much more damage, while the RPG component adds things such as critical hits, dodge chances and miss chances to player and enemies, depending on the circumstances. Using environmental objects is also possible and encouraged in combat, as damage done by debris is very high.
The combat is overall solid, fun, and straightforward, balanced well and polished in all its aspects.

💰 [b] Content & Pricing [/b]
Priced at 15 USD, and offering about 7-9 hours of good quality content, though without any replay-ability to mention, and no other modes, I can safely say the price is worth it for the proposed amount of content.

🔗 [b] Balance & Challenge [/b]
The game generally results balanced well enough, though boss fights could be more challenging. The difficulty level is pre-determined and ramps up considerably near the end of the game, with one specific level being a severe difficulty spike. Generally the challenge level is average, though. There are no particular balance problems to mention.


[h1] Technical Analysis [/h1]


🎥 [b] Graphics [/b]
Very clean and pleasant hand-drawn style, consistent in quality throughout the whole game. Effects and physics are also of good quality, adding a modern feel to an otherwise classic game concept. 

🔊 [b] Sound [/b]
Decent sound effects and soundtrack, but nothing so good to need a special mention.

🔩 [b] Performance & Stability [/b]
Occasional stuttering can happen at random, but is quite rare, and is solved on level transition. During a specific level, a number of enemies so huge can spawn together to make the game unplayable, because of the < 10FPS frame-rate it will reach in this specific scenario, even on an high-end machine. Apart these issues, the performance is generally good.

💻 [b] Artificial Intelligence [/b]
Enemy AI uses a follow and attack pattern as it is common in this genre.

🏠 [b] Quality of Life [/b]
Inventory, interfaces and UI generally work well and present no particular issues.

🐛 [b] Bugs & Issues [/b]
No problems to report.


[h1] Conclusion [/h1]
[b]Zombotron[/b] is a definitely good side-scrolling shooter with an old-school feel to it mixed with modern elements and mechanics. Surely, a game to keep an eye on, and a safe bet for fans of platformers and shooters.

This product was reviewed using a free key provided by the Developers."
"Second of three parts of an overarcing story, where the protagonist (choose your name) ends up in an alternate world and at a tavern... where, well... he can end up in intimate situations... Decent enough."
"Really fun platform shooter! I think it is really fun to play it, even more with the amazing retro soundtrack, that make me feels back into Castlevania times, I had a really good time playing this game. It is astounding to see that a indie company made this game, it is incredible, really recommend it"
"First off, I'd like to point out that I think of myself as a pretty solid fan of the entire Neptunia franchise, I own every game on PC, and because of this I felt like I didn't want to give this game a negative review. Instead of writing an essay on all of the issues that have been discussed in the steam discussions already, I'll just point out a few of the pros and cons there were at least for me.


Pros
- It's a Neptunia game! ( only really matters if you're a nep collector like me )
- The character designs and particle effects are well made. It's satisfying to swing around a giant flaming popsicle as nep.
- The new outfits for all the characters are neat and cute.
- The music for the most part is really good, none of it recycled from previous games.
- No recycled levels from previous games ( despite them being boring ).


Cons
- Plutia is not a playable character. --- This is unforgivable. ---
- Uzume and Peashy are also not playable.
- The netcode is awful so multiplayer is literally unplayable unless you're lucky or in the same room. This was pretty much the selling point for me and ended up being a complete and utter disappointment, apparently it's just like the PS4 version.
- The combat is boring, there is seemingly no skill required, just target enemy, mash buttons and spam your best ability.
- The customization options are lackluster, bad hair colors and very few actual costumes. Accessories only show up on your main character and not on NPC party members.
- Level design is boring, there are no landmarks just open fields, or empty dungeon cooridoors. One level toward the end seemingly uses default Unreal Engine assets which felt cheap and kind of threw off the immersion for me.
- This one isn't actually their fault, but there is supposedly no Live2D support in Unreal Engine, so the dialogue cutscenes are all still-frames with simple camera focus animations and particles.
- There will probably be no bug fixes, as we have seen no response from IF regarding their efforts to improve the netcode or fix other issues.


I can understand that working in a brand new engine, especially Unreal, is outside of their comfort zone, but the way the product was handled after release feels like they just dumped the game on us, took the money and ran and that's probably exactly what they did. I do not recommend you buy this unless its on sale and if you really really REALLY want it despite knowing the flaws.

Really, really, really wanted to like this game, yet it kinda just hurts looking at it in my library. Maybe if they make a new game with Plutia as a playable character I'll consider overlooking this trainwreck."
"Let me start by saying that I am a huge Swords and Sandals fan. These games have given me countless hours of entertainment for over a decade. That said, I cannot, in good conscience, recommend this release in its current state. Swords and Sandals has never been a glitch-free game, but there are several glitches new to the Steam version, including some gamebreaking ones.

Swords and Sandals 1, 3, and Crusader appear to be functional. SaS 4 has some annoying bugs for some minigames, but works overall. Swords and Sandals 2, the best of these games in my humble opinion, is broken due to a glitch that I will elaborate on below.

If you want to buy this game to put some money in the pocket of Oliver Joyce as a thank you for the hours of free entertainment, then you should know that you are not getting a fully functional version of the classic SaS games. If you're new to the franchise, you're better off purchasing more recent titles- they're not quite the same as these old gems, but they are quality games for the most part.

---
Below are a list of the glitches I was able to document. Though I understand that the devs might not see much financial benefit from fixing them, the Steam version may be the only way to play these classic gems now that Adobe flash is becoming unsupported by most browsers. For the sake of preserving these great games, I do hope you are able to fix these!

*MAJOR*
In SaS II, sleeping and taunting have essentially been combined. When you have sufficient energy, you regain stamina and health like you are sleeping every time you taunt. This drags out fights to an extreme degree and throws off the game's balance completely. Furthermore, the lack of stamina loss means that one can essentially taunt forever, making high charisma builds the only really viable ones.

In SaS Mini-fighters, you straight up skip the first tournament, receiving the prize as soon as you beat the fearful prisoner. You still have to manually level up to level 7 before you can participate in the second tourney. Enemy scaling is also incredibly off- You'll regularly be facing off against 10 foot tall giants (apparently the same level as you) that can take out your entire HP pool in one hit at level 5.

MINOR
All of the unique trivia for the arena champions in SaS II has been replaced with generic randomized trivia. 

After watching the intro cinematic for SaS I, you will start with the armor/clothes that you are wearing in the cutscene, instead of nothing. Not sure if this is intentional or not.

In SaS IV, the Swords and Snacks minigame is broken. No weapons or snacks appear. The only way to end the minigame is to stand in one spot until you fall through the floor until you lose all of your lives, and there's no way to earn any coins.

In SaS IV, during the Bat Harvest minigame, the player just moves to the left position and is stuck there until time runs out.

In SaS IV, when one unlocks Deepnether Caverns at level 10, it instead shows a card for Arkmagius Mountains.

LEGACY
SaS III still does not acknowledge if you spared the life of an arena champion in the story text, stating that you ended their life regardless.

I may add more glitches as I find them. I will also update this review if the devs are able to fix things up.

2019-01-09: Added some more bugs I found, removed some that were fixed in the Jan 5 patch."
This classic was made with a modified version of the Wolf3D engine. Comparing the difference between them i'd say it's quite impressive.
"I usually never leave reviews but I wanted to post my positive review here to help with some of the negative feedback the game has been getting in the last month, due to a steering bug that has since been patched and fixed, which I think is important people know, plus I genuinely love this game.

I've been playing this game for the better part of 2 years, since it was in early access, and honestly it's only gotten better and better.  This game absolutely owns, go look at any gameplay footage and you'll see people having a great time, myself included with a Let's Play series I did, just having an absolute blast.  It's such an homage to the Rollcage series and you can tell a lot of love has been put into this project.  By far the best combat racing experience I've had to date.

Oh and it also has Drum & Bass so it's instantly 10/10 I mean come on"
"It's Minesweeper but not a clone.  An original Minesweeper game, Globesweeper offers different shapes in the form of hexes and triangles in addition to the classic squares.  Board can be rotated and scaled.  Themes can be applied once un-locked.  Very nicely done.  A+"
Flora and fauna deficit compensated.
"A good followup to the original AVGN Adventures. This one pays homage to a lot more of the AVGN world lore. The world map design is more like Super Mario Bros 3. I enjoyed this game, and you will too but there are a couple things worth noting: I still think the first game is better. The original is by far more difficult and I think the music was better, too. It was also the first mainstream game featuring AVGN, and that played a big role in its enjoyability by feeling fresh. 

I still recommend this game, but I liken the comparison between AVGN and AVGN 2 to Raiders of the Lost Ark and The Last Crusade. Most everybody chooses Raiders as the better film, but Last Crusade is still high up there and worth watching. AVGN 2 is a more expansive game and brings fans of the first more entertainment of the same kind, but it lacks just a bit of the calibre the first one had, surprisingly. 

Still, it's recommended and I would definitely pay for a third game if its more of the same we've received with these last 2 titles.

"Let me start by saying that this is one of my [b]favorite[/b] games at the moment. 

I think we all have times when we just don't know what to play, or you just want to relax and not play CS:GO against spinbotter... This is the game that fills this gap. 
I randomly saw this game and instantly fell in love with the assets. 

In the beginning it was a little hard to get an overview of all the buttons, but they were all pretty self understanding. After I played a little around I started working on a house. And let me tell… it is [b]SO SATISFYING[/b] to do build anything in this game... the animations are on spot <3 I posted it on the Discord of bblessed Gamestudios and the Developer loved it… so sweet.

[b]PROS:[/b]
 - Design
 - Variety of assets
 - Satisfying to build
 - Big Potential
 - ITS FREE

[b]CONS:[/b]
 - Has some bugs (But I've seen worse for an Early-Access)


Overall I would definitely recommend to [b]anybody[/b]!

"Great game with gameplay reminiscent of Oddworld and Mask of the Ninja, combined in the the worlds of The Last Airbender and Golden Sun. It's evident much love and care has gone in to this, from all the different combinations of stealth and elemental wielding in gameplay, to world building and art/sound design. Replayability is also well thought out, with secret areas, challenges, and cooperative play meaning you'll definately get your moneys worth. Very stable also, with zero crashes. Played more previously due to being a kickstarter, so actual hours are more than what's displayed here.

Playing alone or with a friend, I can highly recommend this game!"
"What a cute (and a bit sad) game! The art is adorable and the music is relaxing. The story is great and since thee's no actual verbal dialogue, it can be understood and played by everyone regardless of your language (of course you still have to navigate through the menu and whatnot). The story had a bit of depth to it, and it does leave the player a bit of guesswork in the end, but no matter how you piece together the ending, it's still really good (although, again it can be a bit sad). The puzzles themselves are mostly easy, I only had a bit of trouble with 2 or 3 of them, but I could eventually figure them out.

Overall, I do recommend this game if you want a relaxing, easy puzzle game."
"This game is absolutely worth the money. Awesome time killer.. No seriously, TIME KILLER! 
11PM I was messed up tired and ready for bed, looked at the clock, told myself ""aight one more round then I can sleep"" that was almost 6hours ago -,-

The variation in this is pretty low, you can pretty much memorise the items value if you got a decent memory. 
I hope more events come along, maybe some ""defence"", people who play the game know what I mean by ""defense"".
Anyway, worth! Get it if, you just want a cheap game to get by a slow day :)"
"Better than the first one I think. Troublesome settings however, like the first one.
It's fun for a little timekiller, but for me it got too hard. Perhaps I'll try again some other time."
"This game is too good to be free, but the downfall is the poor grammar.

The horrorr aspects gave me thrills and the true ending was really sad."
"

"I found this after heading out to the old school arcade with five bucks to finally beat this damned game. My friend and I were both bummed to find out they'd sold the arcade cabinet for it. I came home and did a search and saw it had come out on Steam.

I've played the crap out of it and can say that it is still, to this day, the best side-scrolling beat-'em-up out there."
A platformer that's easy to get started with. It's easy enough to figure it out. There are a lot of levels. You can fight or jump over monsters. Bats somehow very unpleasantly chase the player. I wish they worked a little differently. It's nice to see the presence of in-game achievements.
"Glare1more is one of the inaugural uncensored adult titles on Steam, and also the first visual novel I've come across which utilizes a text entry interface for gameplay. The game is rather short and limited in scope, and the adult content is unimpressive; that said, the text entry system is used to great effect, [spoiler]especially at the climax,[/spoiler] and the heroine's Live2D animations enhance various story and gameplay moments. The translation is fine. I recommend this game to anyone who's curious or wishes to test their reading comprehension. If you're seeking quality literature or smut, though, go get Grisaia."
"Having liked what I saw when I skimmed the original Japanese version (Shizuku no Oto -sound of drop-), I was very excited when I learned that this game was going to be localized. Since I know very little Japanese, having the game in English was a dream come true. This version manages to be even better than the original.

Sound of Drop -fall into poison- (AKA Shizuku no Oto -fall into poison-) is an expanded remake of the original 2014 game. The game has been rebuilt from the ground up in the Ren'Py engine with dual-language settings. In addition to this, a large amount of new content was added to the game, which almost doubles the playtime. The bonus routes that are added to this version of the game not only expand on characters that were a bit lacking in characterization in the original, but adds a new character to the story seamlessly. One of the 7 new endings added for -fall into poison- ended up being my favorite ending in the game.

The story is a horror/mystery set in an aquarium that has spawned numerous urban legends. While the story expects you to take a lot on faith early on, almost everything is explained in one or more of the ""True Endings"" to the story. While some of the characters are lacking on development in the original route, they are expanded on enough in the new scenario to make everyone an interesting character to learn about.

To get the most out of this game, be prepared for at least 2-3 full playthroughs and using save files to find the extra endings. While many of the ""Bad Endings"" will mostly interest horror and/or gore fans, it's nearly essential to get all of the ""True Endings"" to get the full story of the game. The new content requires completing one of the original True Endings to unlock (sort of like a New Game+ bonus), so you'll want to start a new game as soon as you finish an ending.

Bottom line: If you're someone who is interested in a horror/mystery visual novel focused on a mostly-female cast, you'll want to get this game."
"The game is beautiful, nice music, great graphics, the theme of pirates I like very much, because I love everything about pirates. If you like games with marine themes, as well as turn-based strategy. then this game is definitely for you."
"Interesting short visual novel presented in a refreshing comic book style. Honestly, nothing much is like this on steam. The music, art and voice acting are very memorable."
"Just finished this.  Great game, puzzles are creative and have just the right amount of difficulty.  Conducting the train listening to the tuned-in radio was really fun.  A bit short and not much replayability, but easily worth the asking price."
"Tags: Sidescroll Brawler
Additional Tags: Delete Local Content & Remove from Library

TLDR: Charming despite its age. However the platforming is imprecise, the combat is unsatisfying and the level design is bland. Nostalgia only."
"Bought it for the ""lol fetish game"" but then it turned out to be actually amazing.
This is one of the best indie 2d platformers i've played in a long time.
The eating/size mechanics are a huge core element with puzzles and enemies all based around it.
They put the game-play first, and the fetish stuff is just is sitting in the back seat giving you playful winks from time to time.

Okay cutting this review short, I'm starting to get a little hungry..."
"if you miss armored core, and maybe you were let down by 'new' gundambreakers, get this game and be at peace."
"[h1] Game Summary: [/h1] 
At this point, I may as well address the issue that arose from the developer revoking keys sold through various bundle websites.  From the various posts and statements that have come out, it seems likely the developer was not acting in good faith throughout this.  With their game being ported to console, at which point the price on Steam increased, it seems like they had what I'd call sellers remorse.  If it's good enough to be ported, it surely can't be a bargain-priced, dime a dozen game anymore, so why let all those keys that were sold on the bundle sites remain when they went for so cheap?  I will still review the game as I always do, but this is a red flag for the developer, who I won't trust in the future.  


[h1] Pros: [/h1] 
•	Having both a short-range weapon and projectiles, even with limited ammo, does provide options for platforming and combat.  The spears work well for making platforms (though if you run out, I guess you're screwed), and the blades are good boss trashers since they boomerang.  
•	There are four choices for what graphics style you want to play in, and they emulate older-style game consoles.  I'm surprised this isn't a choice when starting the game; I only discovered it when pausing.  Features like this should be highlighted, not barely noticeable.  
•	Although I didn't like the default controls for the game, I was able to customize my set-up in the options.  WASD (though there doesn't seem to be a point for moving up and down?), Space to jump, J to attack, and K to throw weapons.  
•	The plot is very thin, but it's appropriate for the era of gaming being emulated.  
•	Including boss fights, there are 26 stages in total.  


[h1] Cons: [/h1] 
•	The game has blind jumps, where you'll either fall down or jump towards a series of  platforms with obstacles you can't react to in time.  For instance, when you land on the first platform, it might be a falling one, so you have to keep moving forward, and as you progress, you'll encounter obstacles you couldn't foresee and be hit.  This includes instant death areas too!  You desperately need a way to look around you.  
•	There are invisible walls, branching pathways, and other hidden areas.  However, this turns out to be a detriment to the game because it will require you to get keys going one route, when you accidentally went right to the blocked-off area.  Since there's no way to know any of this in advance, you can get really screwed over.  
•	There's a lives system in the game, and when it drops to zero, instead of starting a stage at the last checkpoint, you have to start at the very beginning.  I'd prefer having infinite lives because of the annoying stage design and instant death traps.  The game is still pretty easy though.  
•	It's annoying navigating the menu, as it scrolls with your mouse cursor, but doesn't always respond to being clicked on by the mouse.  It seems inconsistent and is a pain to deal with.  
•	Bosses don't have an HP bar, so there's no way to know how far you are in the fight.  However, the final boss' third phase is so punishable, he's the easiest one.
•	Though your health-bar looks large, you lose health in big chunks, yet many health refills barely heal you.  
•	Except for the boss track, only one song loops through the whole game.


[h1] Conclusion: [/h1] 
The fiasco with the developer certainly colors my perspective of the game, as much as I would want to stay impartial.  There are some good aspects, which is reflected by many other reviews of frustrated and outraged players.  However, though the game has some charm, even without the developer's foul-up, I'd find it lacking.  I might have recommended it as a rough but worth trying experience otherwise, but due to the developer revoking earlier sales because they saw the game's value increase, I avidly want to warn everyone to avoid this game.  What's hilarious about this is that it's a game that you can defeat in about 2-3 hours, with no replay value, so how do they conclude it's worth $8 despite doing nothing to validate its price increase?  We all make mistakes, yet when it's your hard-earned money, you have no reason to give someone the benefit of the doubt that they won't screw you over again.  That's part of my rationale for playing through the game now and reviewing it before something else goes wrong."
"Great little platformer that pays hommage to the NES era. Does away with everything fancy and focuses on getting the gameplay right. No weapons outside of your fists (true ninja!), no crazy combos and most certainly no dubstep. Would think the chosen colour pallete might be hard on the eyes or make the game more difficult but it did not. Keyboard was manageable but gamepad is recommended, both were able to be remapped. Supports 4k+ screen resolutions, unlimited fps and 120hz+ panels.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0z3rmcFbVA
Price is low due to the length not the quality, 7 worlds to traverse each with a boss fight at the end. Levels contained collectable coins that are used to unlock 'extras', which generally made the game more difficult, eg no checkpoints. Veterans will find it on the easyside but still very enjoyable and worth a playthrough for the price."
"First Impressions:
Lives to the spirit of the original. The difficulty seems to be curved to be more friendly but still very challenging. The weapon rebalancing and addition of magic are greatly appreciated. The torches seem actually usable now."
"Trails of Cold Steel is a good entry point to The Legend of Heroes series, if the ""old school"" graphics of Trails in The Sky don't appeal to you and you prefer ""fancy 3D graphics"". Aside from graphics, Cold Steel games share the same flaws and virtues as Sky: They are long games, with a very slow start and an overwhelming amount of dialogues. But it's the price to pay for a rich story, detailed character development, and incredible world-building. There's a lot of lore hidden in books and dialogues, and NPCs react to the changes in the world that surrounds them as the story progresses, to the point that some will remember if you helped or interacted with them in the previous game. The combat is still turn based, and the game doesn't force you to grind to advance the story as in other RPG.

The PC port is very well optimized, has lots of graphic settings (uncapped FPS, HBAO+, Draw Distance and Depth of Field sliders, etc.) and works even on old laptops. It does feature some quality-of-life features such as Turbo Mode, skipping battle animations, natively load modded textures, inmediate load last saved game without loading screeen/menus, etc.
"
"This demake looks, plays, and controls better than the original game.  It actually made me enjoy the original game more than I would have otherwise (I completed the Demake before playing the original game)."
"G-senjou no Maou – The devil on G-String is a mystery-thriller visual novel is developed by AKABEiSoft2 and published by Sekai Project and was released on November 5, 2015 on the Steam platform. Originally released in 2008, the Steam Release of G-senjou no Maou – The Devil on G-String marks AKABEisoft2’s first officially localized release. The Devil on G-String prices at $19.99 for the standard edition of the game, and $39.99 for a fully-voiced (in Japanese) version of the game. Both versions of the game will be discounted 30% until November 12.

[h1]The Story [/h1]
You will play as Azai Kyousuke, the adoptive son of a yakuza boss you will see the world through his eyes as he puts up a facade of being a “rich person with taste” to keep his classmates away from him. He often enjoys listening to Bach and “working” part time for his stepfather. But when a beautiful girl named Usami Haru appears in town along with an international criminal known as “Maou,” they bring with them their cat-and-mouse game of plotting and intrigue.

[h1]Visual and Music elements [/h1]
[b]Visual Elements[/b]
Backgrounds and CGs are beautiful and detailed very well done overall very smooth looking sprites and they look really cute when i first saw Miwa Tsubaki sprite with the cute “Ahoge” above her head my first impression was “wow she looks really cute”. There is also time based character color calibration which is a really cool addition because it makes the character have Evening and Night color immersion which adds to the overall atmosphere of the visual novel.

[b]Music[/b] in the menu give that creepy feeling when you play in the dark I loved the overall creepy atmosphere it manages to set and I loved the way they can turn the creepy and dark atmosphere into a cheery and cute atmosphere all with the use of music that goes along with the gloomy and bright colors being put to use. Overall music being used in the game is good

[h1]Interface and Features[/h1]
They have features like having song titles appearing at at the top right of the screen when a new song plays with the composer name.
They also have the feature to change specific characters text colors which not many Visual Novel have this feature which I find this a nice feature to have because sometimes the words colors may blend into the background and thus making it very hard to read them.

[h1]To sum up [/h1]
I would definitely recommend this visual novel to anyone because this visual novel overall would appeal to most people and would recommend anyone that likes mystery/thriller genre with investigations going on all around in the visual novel.

A true masterpiece of our age. I could not recommend it enough to any long time PC gamers as well as people new to PC gaming. 10/10 Knacksterpiece.
"[b]""I hope to arrive to my death, late, in love and a little drunk."" - Atticus[/b]

Well, if you have enjoyed the first in the series, [i]Hero of the Kingdom[/i], you will most definitely love this one! [i]Hero of the Kingdom II[/i] brings back the resource management + hidden object pattern in a new story, in the same setting. This time, the world is way more diverse, with a lot more to explore and accomplish - yet same in means of presenting you casual playtime for an RPG scenario without any rush or action at all.

This time, we play the story of a new hero-to-be, who has lost his parents in an earthquake. Our hero and his precious little sister - the only living relative that remains - are taken in by a kindly old fisherman. They live in relative peace for a while, but their grateful solitude comes to an end when a pirate ship attacks the little coastal town and kidnaps the sister! Well, you know the drill this time. We are to take a journey through the known world in hopes of saving that sister. The story takes place sometime after the first game, at the southern part of the same world. There are even some references to our previous hero. Here starts a new zero to hero scenario, full of seafaring, micromanagement and pirates.

I must say that the story is a little less generic this time, with a truck load of elaboration. Here is an example of developers learning and improving upon a good structure. The story has some twists, thrill and even some mystery this time, successfully. There will come a point in the game, that you'll actually get worried about what will happen. You can gather some companions from side quests too, and they will serve you in various ways. Well, none of the NPCs are greatly memorable, but the setting still bears the naive beauty of a casual AD&D game session.

Well... this is basically the same game, compared to the previous one anyhow. Only with a different scenario and a lot more content. So, what is actually new? Well, there are more skills and collectibles added - more content for the HOG part, to begin with. And quite a many new side quests and ways of building renown too. Some of the side quests are even missable this time. The game makes a little less hand holding and doesn't always declare a point of interest out loud anymore. So, if an NPC mentions something: a place, an item, something to do etc., it would be worthwhile to check that on your own. That is how you will discover treasures. Oh, and considering some point of interests will be active only after you learn about the related skill or knowledge, the game has a truckload of backtracking. You'll find yourself scouring the same 30 or so map pieces again, and again, and again. Is it annoying though? Nah, it is casual and relaxing actually. Because even though everything is limited to same bits of mechanics, the story keeps you interested. You sit before the game to look around for an hour or so, then you find yourself finishing the game 8 hours after. Weird, huh?

As I said at the beginning: if you have liked the previous one, you'll love this one anyhow. If you didn't, stay away 'cause it's more of the same. You have no idea? Try the first game, or maybe the free demo version. Then, you can kill an evening or two before this casual RPG story and call it a nice enough experience. Oh, by the way, the third game is already under development, so it might be a good enough time to check the series. Good gaming to you all!

"Fun and humorous for only 0.99, its well worth the price."
"It's the best new tycoon game I've played in years.  The only two things I don't like about it are the lack of enough available good employees and tediously spamming gold star pictures to keep hospital attractiveness up.  There is a mod that will take care of the employee issues.  There is a lot of attention to detail in the game.  Some of the animations in the treatment rooms are quite funny.  Water runs out of the waterfall painting.  Things like that.

I got this on sale, and it is definitely worth the price that I paid.  However, I don't think that I would pay $35 for it.  I'm a single mom, and money is tight.  So, part of that is my circumstances.  If the price isn't an issue for you, I would recommend it to anyone who likes tycoon games."
"Quick little game that makes me feel powerful towards the end. Perhaps a bit more challenge, but thoroughly enjoyed it. This would be a perfect arcade cabinet game! :)"
"I had a lot of fun with this.  Good variety in the mission types and builds.  You can easily respec to try out different builds, which I think may be required if you want to try to gold star all the missions.  The builds are meaningful and actually change the way you play the missions.  I also appreciated how the way armor works keeps all units usefull throughout the campaign.  

There have been a few bugs, but the developers are responsive and are patching quickly.  I didn't run into anything too bad through my playthrough.

I think my biggest complaint is that it doesn't tell you the optional goal (to get the star) the first time you play the map/mode.  With 33 maps and 3 modes a map, I think there is enough play time without having to complete every map/mode once to figure out what the optional goal is.

Definitely recommended."
"Cute anime girl adventure! Excellent quality RPG about an Alchemist taking over the business. Grind monsters, collect ingredients, take quests, buy new outfits, and discover ancient mysteries in the main quest (when you get around to doing it)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egl0EWQrWqU"
"Very hard for me to change the language to the English, can anyone help me?"
"Played it in alpha state on Itch.io and already had so much fun, then backed it on Kickstarter and was so sad when it didn't gather enough interest. I was then sure that it never would be finished, and now I'm so excited that it is fully released!

To me, this is a lighter ""Factorio"" and chill game which provides the same actual feel of pride and accomplishment of starting out small and then seeing your village and production become bigger and more streamlined.

Also, if you want to learn a bit about the logic behind programming or see your kids try it, check this out!"
"Generally speaking I just don't have the sort of brain that does me much good when it comes to adventure games and their unique brand of logic - that being said, this particular title came into my possession via a bundle, and against my better judgment I decided to give it a quick whirl. 

As it happens, I wound up playing it straight through to the end in one go; not a major accomplishment, since the episode doesn't last much beyond an hour or two, but aside from the occasional ""oh, wait, the screen scrolls further here?"" moment the pieces fit together in a way that even my point-n-click-challenged cranium could keep up with, and the quirkily appealing artwork and voice acting (just beware, when the trailer mentions copious groan-worthy puns, it means it) did a good job of selling the cartoonish Victorian pomposity that this brief, silly detective caper is built upon.

I can only imagine that Lucasarts veterans and the like will be left wanting here, but if, like me, you're the sort who's always had trouble wrapping your head around this storied genre you'll likely be looking forward to the next episode - there are certainly worse ways to waste a bit of free time, especially if you just so happen to save a few bucks in the process."
"  This is the closest thing to Pokemon that has ever been released on steam, A+. Multiple evolutions for every monster that i've imprismed (captured) so far and no graphics issues on my end, but I've heard amd users mentioning issues. So, If you like pokemon, final fantasy and stacking rodents on your head, this game's for you.

  P.S We need more developers to work on monster taming rpg titles for release on steam, It's such a wide market and seeing how pokemon monopolizes the genre on consoles, it would be an easy profit for an experienced dev. Aside from Siralim, it's an untapped market on steam. A really polished monster tamer doesn't exist on steam ( I don't count ARK because it has a different goal than a game like pokemon). If someone could pull it off they'd make BANK, son."
"Much like Cities Skylines is the spiritual successor to Sim City 4. Ostriv is the spiritual successor to Banished. 

Years ago I gave Life is Feudal: Forest Village, a 'finished' game with a similar premise, a negative review for bugs and imbalanced gameplay loop. However, Ostriv receives my positive endorsement in an alpha state. If all that were to happen from Alpha 3 to final release was to close some game play loops and production lines then this will be an incredible game. However, it seems that the developer has much more in mind and makes me both hopeful and excited for future updates. 

This is a strong economic city building game in the same way that Dawn of Man is a robust survival city building game. This game rises above the failures and catastrophes of games like LOF:Forest Village, or Sim City 2013.  If you like Dawn of Man, Cities Skylines, Banished, Frostpunk. or Surviving Mars (which this game seems to be heading toward this echelon of quality) then this is a game where you should support the developer and try for yourself."
God I wish Shun Akiyama was real
"(Key received among many from Zaraki Snakenoman.  Thanks, bro!)

Review 250 and within the past 24 hours I've come to a stunning realization...  So this is a review + realization.  A ""reviewalization"".

[i]Spikit[/i] is advertised as a bullet-hell and as such, it holds its promise.  However, it's not something I can recommend in good faith.  While playing [i]Spikit[/i], I was having a conversation with a (now-ex) acquaintance where a good question entered my mind.  ""Where's the fun?""

As time goes on, I've noted that I've become a bit too obsessed with achievements that I don't pay attention to a very important aspect.  My own happiness.  Why am I doing this?   Why am I torturing myself for so little benefit?  Is it fun to suffer from anxiety?  Is it fun to always strive for perfection?

The thing is, it's fine to have a little stress that allows you to focus and feel like a badass (as bullet-hells tend to do).  But why would you pay to suffer?  Shortness of breath, fast/violent heart-beating, and a light-headed sensation?  It's an unpleasant experience that again raises the question ""Is this fun?"".

The gameplay is exactly what you'd expect from the trailer.  Your 100% won't come easy, though.  If you choose to buy this game and want your 100%, then the only advise I can offer you is to mash F2 as you play.  It'll make your life a little easier.

Again, I personally don't recommend [i]Spikit[/i] due to my own unpleasant experience.  It simply was not fun and I should pursue things that ARE fun instead of subjecting myself to being tortured for the trivial reason of changing a number.  [i]Spikit[/i] is priced at $1, but for $0.10-$0.25,   I can respect the developer for making this game and that it is a simplistic game that only takes up 5MB worth of space and is not bugged.   But the ultimate question is ""Is this fun?"" and for me, the answer is ""No"".

1/10  This was not fun.  It's time I start finding things that were..."
"This game is genuinely good and deserves all the attention. Whether you're an old-school lover or you're new to the genre and style, this game will surprise you. The team has worked very hard on the game and the result is a good game.

It will be out of early access when the devs are sure there are no catastrophic bugs or crashes. It will also come out on Switch!

The game itself is very inspired in old gameboy dungeon crawler titles and while it might feel difficult at first glance once you get used to the mechanics and controls it's not that difficult. I believe everyone should give it an honest try!"
"great game, great devs, would deffinatly recommend getting it."
"I have a couple of their older CD's but I'm not a what you'd call a ""fan"", so this review has nothing to do with the band.

There are a few problems as others have noted:

* Escape quits the game without warning.
* It's hard to aim magic.
* Some actions require the use of the mouse, like dialogs and using a potion (?).
* There's no map of the areas.
* It's mostly ""hit and run"" fighting with no dodging or blocking.

But all that doesn't matter because it's just plain fun. The areas are fun to explore, it's fun to scramble after coins showering out of chests, and fun to run through the spikey logs and acid spewing statues. 

The repeatable bonus stages seem to be where you make most of the money so make sure to find the 3 bats in each area to open them up.

Edit: I finished it on normal in about 5.8 hours. Nightmare mode looks interesting enough to replay it and find the few collectibles I missed."
WE  NEED ENGLISHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!
"Dynamite Jack is a stealth game.  You have the ability to start with or pickup bombs and a flashlight in order to achieve your goal of reaching the end of the level.  In order to reach the end of the level you will need to evade or kill the soldiers protecting the mines you are walking through, collect key cards and/or destroy colored electrical fields.  The graphics are simple, but work very well for this type of game and definitely let you know if you will be seen or not.  The ability to control your character through the levels is very intuitive and fluid.  The difficulty level ramps up as you progress through the mines and special ways of beating each level are offered such as no flashlight, no deaths, or no kills.  I thoroughly enjoyed the game, beat the game and then came back to unlock all achievements.  A very approachable and fun stealth game that you shouldn't miss."
"Well.. well well well. 

I write this as somebody who has just finished the first scenario of the game and this game now has the moniker of the first city building game that left my hands shaking. Without spoiling anything. This game will take you on a god damn journey from a resource management game to a game that turns you into a combination of a monster and a mad man, frantically pulling levers and and turning cogs trying to hold your city together as it falls apart at the seams.

 The first death in your city feels like a failure but by the end you knowingly send people out knowing they will be dead before the days end. You turn from an administrator trying to run a community to an iron fist lord sending 20 people to their doom so 40 people [i]might[/i] live enacting laws that you raised an eyebrow at earlier as surely insane or joke laws for youtubers to make meme videos over. You started thinking you could flourish. Then you thought you could survive. Then you just want to make it to the next day. And yes. There [b]is[/b] an end, there is a victory to be had but once you reach it you look back at the plans you had before this all happened and realise just how powerless you really were and the game asks you if surviving was really worth the cost and without hesitating you say yes. Because no matter how many lows you sunk to, no matter how brutal and maniacal you became. You survived and you saved a handful of people too and in this game, that's all you can ask for. The people that up until a few minutes ago had transformed from humans you had pledged to save to another resource as disposable as wood or coal. 

Do not play this game to chill out, do not play this game to make something beautiful. Play this game to climb a god damn mountain and when you reach the top spend your time looking at how many scars it left you with. 

Wow."
I have found this very relaxing and the add ons have helped.  I'm doing some of the puzzles from the workshop which also run well.

"[h1]Saints Row: The Third - A third person open-world coop shooter[/h1]

This Saints Row part was in my eyes the BEST Saints Row and one of the best open-world games. 

[b]PROS[/b]
-This game is much fun coop but also can be fun alone
-Almost every system runs this game (I was playing with constant 30 FPS on medium settings with a GT 620 and a low tier quad core i5)
-There exists a BIG sellection of weapons and outfits
-The Story is really epic and is easy to understand
-You can decide between chapters [spoiler]and endings[/spoiler]
-There are many rides with different features (mission cars)
-The map is big, so there is enough space to mess around with the police
-The Upgrading system is really ballanced at some parts
-The character customization is really good and was a gigantic improvement from the Saints Row 2 character customization
-There are many activitys you can play in your spare time

[b]CONS[/b]
-There is WAY too much DLC (some of them only add some outfits or melee weapons)
-This game has WAY too many glitchs (sometimes you can glitch your car in a house and can't get out) and some missions will also glitch when you play coop with another player

[b]For 100% players[/b]
-You need a second player for the three coop achievements and some achievements are anyways easier to do with a second player
-You only have to buy the Genkibowl VII, the Gangstas in Space and the trouble with clones DLC, because only these have achievements
-You can play on easy, because some achievements are really annoying with cops shooting at you

[b]Recommendation[/b]
You DEFINETLY should buy this game if you have the spare money (even when it isnt in sales), but ONLY buy the DLC when it's in sales, because some of them have low to almost no content."
"I'm not really a reviewer but I'll give my thoughts. 

When I bought this out of curiosity, I honestly expected to refund it within the 2 hours mark and man....I was so wrong.

After finishing the game (took 35 hours). I can honestly say I never been this engrossed with a game's story and characters, especially one about actual TROLLS. You would think a RTS game where you play as trolls would be ""basic"" or bland. 

With its impressive and mature approach to storytelling and unique hybrid gameplay, the amount of care and effort the devs must have invested into their game would have been nothing short of massive.

I'm curious as to how a game of this AAA calibre could be released with such little hype. From the story, voice-acting, gameplay and soundtrack. Just amazing. 

I really hope this sells well and the devs don't go under. Talents like this are too few and far between."
"Prepare yourself . . . insects are taking over the galaxy. You are being sent in deep behind enemy lines. It could be a suicide mission; the forces you are up against are strong and well-armed. You also are heavily armed, with your armored vehicle, a broad array of weapons, perks, and support items to bring your own hell to this place. Choose your vehicle carefully; there are 3 to choose from at the start (with 2 more unlockable), their stats are all very different and not upgradable. You will start with basic armaments, upgrading as you go with money you collect from fallen enemies. You can upgrade your weapons and sub-weapons as you unlock them, along with unlocking additional melee, drone, and air support items. Don't forget to invest in yourself as well. Health upgrades and additional drone support can mean the difference between beating a level or getting annihilated.

Released & self-published on Apr 5, 2019, by the developer DG Games Workshop, this is their first release on Steam. It is a Difficult, Top-Down, Pixel Graphic, Bullet Hell with an old school flavor reminiscent of the 80s & 90s arcade games. It does feature partial controller support. I tested my Xbox 360 controller without issue. You can also customize your binding as needed. It contains 15 levels of ever-changing, intense battles against an insect army. Each level has its own deadly boss to fight to advance to the next level. Once you beat it on normal difficulty, there are 2 additional hardcore modes to lay waste to your will to game. There are not a lot of settings; music and sound volumes, resolution, fullscreen or windowed, camera height (this zooms out the map more), there is also joystick auto-aiming and language selector. With tons of weapons and power-ups to aid you, it will still be the fight of your life. They even added the ability to skip a few of the levels using some of your gold coins should you get stuck. This will allow you to keep playing and gaining more money to upgrade and return to the stage later when you may be more powerful.

Quite an impressive title for their first release. It has a lively pixel art style with energetic gameplay. A nice old-school score and sound effects; both are well done and fit the game perfectly.  With massive numbers of bullets, missiles and bombs flying at you and being fired by you, it holds true to being a Bullet Hell from start to finish. It is very challenging, and I would not rate it as casual. I am rating it as difficult; it does have hard-core gameplay also after you beat the normal mode. There was a Demo available, but it was removed as the developer felt it was out of date with the Steam release. I would recommend they reinstate a demo to allow people a chance to see if the game fits their play styles, as it is a very good game, but very difficult. There are no save points during the stages - get defeated and its restart the level! I would have liked to see at least a midway save point, as the bosses are really tough sometimes, and the levels are not really all that short. You do get to grind for more cash this way, though, to get more upgrades. I have done a fair amount of grinding to get upgrades myself, to be a lean mean bug-killing machine! Personally, I feel the bosses could be balanced out a little more; the main game itself is a lot of fun and challenging getting through, but the bosses are very challenging. More often than not, you make a mistake and it’s get wrecked, then start the stage over. I can only imagine what it will be like in the 2 hardcore modes.

We start out our gameplay in a tutorial level to teach us the basic mechanics of the game. There are three levels in total that will lead you through to the advanced mechanics prior to starting the first level. Each level is not only different in style and layout, but enemies, bosses, and the necessary actions to complete it changes with every stage. As you progress through the stages you will want to purchase additional slots and power-ups for your vehicle and yourself. Getting the right combination to fight a particular area can be fun and challenging to figure out which combinations work best. With a large arsenal at your disposal, there is plenty of pain to rain down on your enemy. I really liked the fact that they included an additional view with the high camera view. It allows you to see most of the map compared the small area you see if you do not use it. The ultimate power you have is pretty epic too. I didn't realize I had it at first, I mistook its indicator for something else. Lucky for me, my son noticed, and we figured out I had additional firepower to kick some insect booty with. The mechanics in general were a riot, and I enjoyed discovering them as I played and discovered that they constantly changed, keeping every stage fresh and interesting. As usual, I will leave these for you to discover on your own. I didn't discover any bugs, besides the ones I was predestined to slay during my gameplay.

"""Self-Reliance"" is undoubtedly one of the most enjoyable games I have in my library. Its content, gameplay, and core message can easily enable it to compete with AAA 60 dollar games, and it is a great courtesy from the developers to not have monetized this masterpiece in order to educate the masses on critical social issues.

The story arc is entirely player driven; it takes a certain degree of skill, ingenuity, and passion from the developers to make it so. Most dialogue choice games (telltale-esque) render player choices inconsequential, frequently forcing players to adhere to a central plot. ""Self-Reliance"" radically breaks this norm, exploring and expanding upon every choice, this leads to an incredibly realistic and satisfying play through.

The graphics of ""Self-Reliance"" are near photorealistic, and as a software engineer of 35 years, I recognize the immense energy and resources put into developing such an advanced game engine. This game is deserving of my compliment and utmost respect.

The educational aspect of the game is implemented seamlessly into the gameplay itself. As the player progresses through the story, their actions and subsequent consequences warn them of the weight of these choices. The gameplay also serves to simulate these real-life situations, adequately preparing the player.

In a society and culture that treats sex as a taboo subject, the developers have taken it upon themselves to tackle the emergent issue of adolescent pregnancies and sexually transmitted diseases by stressing the importance of safe sex and teaching the necessary steps to avert disaster if contingencies do occur.

For these reasons, this game receives my highest recommendation."
"Requiem: Avenging Angel is a first person shooter released at around the same time as Half-Life and Unreal. Unfortunately it didn't sell especially well and is completely forgotten today.  

Superficially it plays very similar to Quake and Dark Forces 2. It takes place in a religiously inspired setting crossed with sci-fi. You play as an Angel named Malachi sent to Earth to stop Lilith. Who rules over a dystopia that the player is sent to. The world is also hub based and similar to Half-Life it is seamless and only separated by loading screens.

What's strange about Requiem: Avenging Angel is it often gets compared to Half-Life, but surprisingly has many more comparisons to Half-Life 2. The player is an outsider who enters a dystopic world that is controlled by well armed police. And you very early on join a resistance group and have to rescue a woman from a place called ""The Citadel"". It was surprising to me because it felt almost like how Half-Life 2 would've felt if it was made on the GoldSrc engine. 

The gameplay to Requiem: Avenging Angel is relatively interesting for its time. The player has access to angelic powers as well as firearms. Your angel powers start out fairly generic but you get more interesting ones overtime. One of the most amusing powers is one that turns enemies into pillars of salt. It also has a bullet time power. It's a very creative game for its time and it's unfortunate it was so overlooked.

It's Half-Life meets the Bible. A video game 2000 years in the making. It's time to get Old Testament on some fools."
"The Good:
+Great Graphics and Atmosphere 
+Great platforming elements, the main gameplay revolves around you ""switching"" worlds on the fly to collect gems and reach new platforms to progress through the level. 
+Good level of difficulty that ramps up nicely and provides a nice level of challenge
+Lots of modes for replayability ie. score attack, time attack, hardcore mode

The Bad: 
- Can get frustrating at times



This is one of the best platforming games I have played in recent memory. This is definitely a good game and one worth checking out.

"In this game, you can drink 1 soda per level. There are 258 levels. The average soda costs $1.19. If you were to drink 258 sodas in real life, it would cost you $307.02.
So by paying $5 for this game, you save $302.02 on actual soda. The numbers don't lie, this game is an amazing use of your money."
"10/10 would bang... This game is amazing. Every ounce of detail poured into it is easily seen. This game was released in 2k6, and still plays and feels amazing. Steam even hosts the new servers, so this game isn't going down anytime soon."
"This game kind of teaches you how to display elements using HTML and CSS but it is more like practice. It will definetly help you remember some things if you are rusty. BTW, self-study is a good way to learn something so don't get mad at this game just because you can't put that you beat it on your resume."
⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
"Hullo!

I've been following this game since its Kickstarter, and am glad to see it's finally released. After having a considerable play session on my own and then with a friend, I wanted to make some notes for those looking to buy and not as familiar with the game:

[h1]Keep in mind that this is an Early Access title at the time of writing. This does mean the game is not fully released, developed, patched, etc. Content may be missing or buggy. If you are not comfortable investing in unfinished product for future benefit, then do not purchase the game.[/h1]

With that out of the way lets break down the game!

[b]Pros:[/b]
[list]
[*] No stamina bar for general tool usage. This bugged me so much in HM/SoS games as a limiter and as a way to make food relevant. Then again there were key differences between that style of game and this one.
[*] Magic system! Skill trees! This was one of the reasons I personally purchased the game. It reminds me of Rune Factory with the ability to raise different skills (though not as many) to gain benefits such as Exploration, Combat, Mining, etc.
[*] Character Customization allows for use beyond the typical human offerings, with fun little designs that make each lineage/species/race unique to itself.
[*] Ample content to handle and do. There's a lot of quests and polish to the game that I've seen absent in other early access titles. I'm only 8 hours into the game, but I can tell I'll likely be sinking a lot more. 
[*] The art style is charming and the game itself shows incredible promise, especially for a first time development.
[*] The devs are active! They keep their updates consistent and have made a strong commitment to work on the title to its full completion later in the year.
[*] This may be a minor nitpick on my part but you have the option to NOT be a vegan in this game. Something absent from titles like Harvest Moon and SoS. (Milk and Eggs excluded) Finally I can make hamburgers!
[/list]

[b]Cons[/b]
[list]
[*] It is an early access title and currently incomplete. This does mean that you are paying for a game still in development, and there WILL be bugs, crashes, etc. If you are unused to the nature of Early Access, then this may not be the game for you.
[*] Walking currently feels very VERY slow, even moreso knowing that time passes super quickly. It took me only a couple hours to work through several days. 
[*] I have yet to discover or find any sort of 'map' that can help with navigation in the game. You have to rely on memory and if you have issues with direction like I do that's a major problem. I spent the first few days of requests mostly wandering the map aimlessly trying to figure out who was where on a very limited time.
[*] The late night mechanic is somewhat dangerous once past 9 PM. Your character can pass out and then an inordinate amount of time can pass. Seems a bit punishing especially with again how quickly time passes in this game.
[*] The music is charming, when you can hear it. Currently the sound is hard to pick apart from anything else. Normally I have the opposite issue where games make certain sounds or songs way too loud, but in this case they're just way too quiet even at max volume.

All in all, a super cute game that can scratch that Harvest Moon/Story of Seasons itch with a splash of Rune Factory (RF5 where are you?). It's a lot of fun despite the bugs, and its got a great team behind it willing to work hard to improve.

I was a kickstarter backer and acquainted with the games process before it released, so I can't tell you personally whether its worth the $25 USD from an external viewpoint but to me it is. Especially knowing my friends can just drop in and help me farm or play with me. Very nice solo and social game."
give me heroes please
"Walked in knowing it was a short game, meant to be replayed multiple times. I've gotten a game over, and a happy ending so far. 
The flow of the story meshes well. The art work is excellent and cohesive. There's no stuttering emotional frames and pics, it feels well laid out.
The music is never the center, and supports the story and your choices poretty wel, I think.
I'm looking forward to more playthroughs hunting the alternate endings.

It's a great visual novel!

P.S. Other pluses: it does not punish you for exploring the story. Save, go back a frame or two, save, choose something else. Very pleasent."
"Having been introduced to this genre by the delightfully entertaining [i]Detective Jackie: Mystic Case[/i], it was only a matter of time before I started looking into Gamehouse's earlier productions, and as an enthusiast of clothing in games, the [i]Fabulous – Angela[/i] series was an obvious place to start.

[h1]Overview[/h1]
Angela has recently lost her job [i]and[/i] been cheated on by her husband; and is at a low ebb in her life.  She is offered a job at a local boutique, which is where we come in, and the game offers a nice introductory level to help us get started if we are not familiar with what we need to do.  Soon afterwards, it transpires that Angela's heroine, the fashion designer Truly, is holding a televised competition to find the most talented, exciting new designer to ultimately replace her - which will take place over 5 exotic locations (in addition to the starting point of the boutique) containing 15 levels each.  Of course, Angela is hopeful of being selected to appear on the show.  Will she get there?  And if so, what will happen?  Life is never that simple..

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
Is exactly what you would expect from this type of game: serve a series of customers with the item(s) and/or service(s) they want within a timeframe that keeps them happy, in order to earn points which you can then cash in for additional features to make your efforts quicker and/or more efficient as the levels progress.

In this game, those bonuses can be purchased for the duration of each location, such as an extra changing room or additional make-up table so you can serve more customers concurrently; or be repurchased one level at a time, like the magician who performs a trick and improves everybody's mood, which effectively boosts their patience timer and gives you longer to serve them before they leave in a frustrated rage.

[h1]Positives[/h1]
- The story is told via cutscenes between each of 90 playable levels, and it is this which really holds the game together and maintains player interest.  It is very well written and you will find yourself cheering on certain characters whilst pantomime-jeering others as their true natures become apparent.
- Aurally the game also performs well, there is a lovely cheerful introductory song and respectable accompaniments throughout.
- Graphics are right up to scratch for the type of challenge, clean and quickly identifiable as they need to be, whilst remaining colourful in keeping with the overall theme; and some of the dress options are gorgeous.
- Responsiveness to clicking appeared to be flawless.  Even during my most frenetic activity, I never had to click the same thing twice to be sure that Angela would respond accordingly.

[h1]Negatives[/h1]
- There are a number of additional “challenges” thrown in to many of the levels, such as having supplies delivered to the wrong place and having to move them across the room in between serving all the customers; or having to prevent an underhand competitor from sneaking in and sabotaging your work.  These are fun at first, but are very limited in variety and the same ones repeat over; which makes them increasingly tiresome as you progress further.
- While crediting the developers for throwing in little extras to challenge the player, I feel that some of these additions simply don't work well.  There is a mouse in the majority of the levels which you need to find and click on; but it is very small, often hidden behind other scenery so you can see only part of it, and it doesn't stay visible for very long.  When you are really busy keeping up with demand, unless you are very lucky and just-so happen to look in the right spot at the right time, you are likely to miss it altogether.
- Most of the achievements in game are fun to get, but one of them demands you score 500,000 points in total; and you are not going to get very near to that when you have played right through the game, which effectively forces you into grinding some levels over and over to get there.  An avoidable introduction of grind is [i]never[/i] a smart move.  Throw in the likelihood of mouse-spotting adding to that inevitability, and you have some player frustration in a game which could have easily been completely free of it.

[h1]Verdict[/h1]
Overall, the negatives in the game are pretty small and pale in comparison to the fun that you should have from playing it.  There is a lot of repetition – as is the nature of the genre, I suspect – but the gameplay levels are split by delightfully enjoyable cutscene story updates, and a desire to see how everything pans out should be comfortably enough to keep you invested until the conclusion.

At full price, this game costs £10, which might be a touch above fair value, but on offer (and at time of typing, it is less than half price), it becomes a bargain.  If you like time management games, or fun stories, or simply fashion, then [i]Angela's Fashion Fever[/i] should appeal; and if you like all three of those, then the question is, why haven't you bought it already?

"We want the DELUXE version uploaded here for the price we paid for this older plain jane version.

Lavamind  update this to the DELUXE version! Come on!"
Recommended to play with controller and your fiance/fiancee for a load of epic high fives.
"For those who have purchased the Tacview advanced bundle like I did, Tacview isn't isn't set up properly when you first install.

By default the Tacview directory is set to: 

C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Command - Modern Operations

To get it to work you need to reconfigure the Tacview directory under options to:

C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Tacview\Tacview64.exe 

If you don't you will get a legacy version error when you try and load 3D view.

"The game is great, presentation and music are stellar, gameplay is keeping it simple, a bit more variation in enemy formations and bullet pattern would have been nice, but the bosses fully make up for that. The game is running on Unity, so everything scales nicely to whatever res your display is supporting. This might end up being an overlooked gem. So please, by all means, look at it!"
"Good game, but ugly UI and messy english translation."
"I found this game delightful. It is fairly short, but I still enjoyed the story and relationships. The choices were clear and there is a bit of mystery to uncover, so I'm intrigued to play through again and see if I can discover more."
"It's a fun game to play with your gf or bf.
We had a lot of fun. But the game is short. 
About 10~15 dollars for 2 hours gameplay? Well I think it's worth the money depending on how you compare.
Personally it deserved the price of some coffee at least. In that sense I strongly recommend :)"
"As it is I cannot recommend to play this game, for the simple reason that we're in 2019, thus it's been 3 years we're waiting for the end of a story finishing on a cliffhanger. A lot of features have been taken from ""The Last Door"", which DOES have an end, and even a season 2 and which I recommend for doing everything better than the Slaughter.

Pro :
- Interesting character and well written dialogues.. So does ""The Last Door"".
- The dream idea is nice but there is so few to interact with.. If anything.
- If you already have played ""The Last Door"".. Or read that review you already know that you can double click an exit to skip the walking to part.

Con :
- Very similar to ""The Last Door"", in less good, less victorian vibes and with less ending. You even have something similar as the dream in every chapter introduction on ""The Last Door"". It's nice to take inspiration, it's ok to not do as good, the lack of ending is killing it all.
- The character is slow, really slow, which makes it even more annoying when you don't know about the double click trick.
- Not only he is slow, but as soon as you launch an action, you cannot stop him. Which is quite annoying when you miss click at the other side of the windows.
- Shove Ha' Penny should be in the poorest game mechanic ever made top 100.
- No Act two after 3 years waiting, so you reach the end, the cliffhanger, then nothing. I don't understand the positive reviews as it's the biggest con.

Conclusion : Play ""The Last Door"", it's simply better and has an end."
Short but strong just like my D
"The hope of mankind lies within your hands as you take command to keep thousend of aliens from invading your world. As military commander your only help comes from a scientist providing you with new technology and weapons.

'Radiant Defense' is a tower defence game in space. Its colourful, glowing look is beautiful and the comic style can be deceiving. That's because 'Radiant Defense' is not a simple game. Some players even claim it's too hard altogether. But in my opinion that's not really the case. Yes, the game becomes difficult in the higher levels but it's a clever difficulty. While difficult sometimes leads to frustration in 'Radiant Defense' difficult is challenging and inspires to keep trying again and again until you finally win victory. 

Pros:
- nice graphics
- good music
- clever game design
- very good selection of weapons and enemies
- freedom to build your own route in most levels
- more than 300 waves of aliens across 14 missions
- pauses between waves allow you to arrange your weapons
- you can repeat any wave without loosing money if you do not upgrade towers before starting the wave. This allows you to experiment.
- the game automatically saves progress for each level. You can simply stop playing and return right to were you stopped any time later.
- nice tactical component for money. Dead aliens fill your purse but you can increase the money earned by placing money boosters. Additionally you collect further money depending on your funds at the end of each wave. This adds to very interesting tactical twists.
- high number of waves
- nine upgradable weapons
- three super-weapons for mass defence

Cons:
- online hall of fame seems to contain cheaters and you can't find your own position
- one achievement seems bugged (Endangered Species)"
"I like it very much but I'd love it if you had to rotate the pieces. Also I wish they'd change the titles so it said Animated Jigsaws first then the specific title Wildlife, Beautiful Japanese Scenery, Japanese Women so they'd end up all together in my list instead of being separated. When you have 1700 titles that's a lot of separation between common titles. I should also add that most PC jigsaw games are terrible because they use lazy jig cuts where the pieces are almost all the same two or three shapes. These titles do a much better job with that."
"I watched some of my favorite Hololive play this game, and oh boy is it fun. I love me some beat em up games with a bit of farming simulator. Also, doesn't hurt that Naomi Oozora (Satania) is the VA for the main character. HA↗HA↘HA↗HA↘HA↗HA↘HA↗"
"Very enjoyable game, easy to learn but not so simple to master, each time you play you get more and more insights to keep going on higher scores!"
"Really fun combination between Tower Defense and RPG
You upgrade heroes instead of towers
Cute graphics 
a variety of units with different upgrades and abilities
Tons of challenges and side quests
Has achievements and trading cards!"
"The majority of people who bought this game originally played it on Xbox Live Arcade. That seemed like years ago, and after the very long wait, we're finally able to play it on Steam. The wait was worth it though, this game is still just as fun as I remember. When it comes to twin-stick wave-based zombie shooters, this is definitley one of the best. The pixel art and 8-bit zombie gore is very appealing, and is especially fun when playing with a friend. 

The game also seems very balanced with the weapons, characters and perks. The ridiculous amount of obscure weapons you can buy also adds a lot of replay value and offers several different strategies. Plasma swords, robot minions, healing totems, frost arrows, bio rifles, bubble bazookas, cattle launchers, orbital strikes, just to name a few. There's a lot of kooky characters to choose from as well, each with there own stats and very unique starting weapon. Perks are also worn as hats on top of the small bonuses, and you can unlock more characters and cosmetic wear by earning coins after each run. I was also suprised to see tons of new enemies and creatures every time I restarted, making each run very refreshing. This game has a lot of depth to it, and is so much better than most of the other generic zombie shooters."
"One of my favourite games. 
Not actually a game but a mountain flying in space simulator. Good graphic, sound and great idea.
I usually leave it open on background for ambient sounds.

My friends are jelous that I'm such a high-level alpinist now."
"Mass Effect 1 was the first game I ever completed on PC back in 2008 or so, and the entire Mass Effect trilogy remains one of my favourite gaming experiences of all time. Naturally when I saw this Legendary Edition was priced at £54.99, I was like, nah. I've already paid for all these games on Origin. I've completed them. I don't have time for this anyway. Why would I go ahead and spend over £50 on it, and I closed it.

It was like a little alien brain-worm had invaded me. I kept thinking about it. Wondering about all the DLC I never bought. Wondering about how it would play in 2021 in 4K Ultra HD glory. Why did I even buy this fancy ass monitor if I wasn't going to buy Mass Effect Legendary Edition? I was already thinking about the playthrough I was going to have, the choices I was going to make, how epic it would be to experience games 1-2-3 back to back rather than waiting years in between and forgetting half the details.

So yeah, I bought it. I've sunk some time into the first one - which is arguably the one that needed a bit of TLC the most. It may actually take me years to finish all three with the amount of free time I have lately (screw you, real life), but I'm off to a good start, reliving the experience. I'd forgotten how tough some of the decisions in the first game were.

It really looks fantastic, I've not experienced problems with bugs (touch wood) and it runs on my PC like a dream. Playing the first game for a second time 12 years later has managed to capture both nostalgia and a fresh feel for me somehow. Probably because I've forgotten just enough detail to make half of it seem new, whilst remembering the other half. It's a smoother experience, but not streamlined or dumbed down for the masses (phew). It's kept that undefinable je ne sais quoi. I was worried some of the atmosphere might be missing - but it's definitely still there. It still feels like something special. But even better.

I never would have prioritised replay the original games, but this re-release gave me the motivation to revisit one heck of an epic series and I have no regrets. Don't expect any new reviews from me for some time though, this one's going to take a wee while to complete! I've even started looking at the achievements and wondering if I could 100% it, wish me luck.

"The Quest captures perfectly the look of old grid-based first-person RPG’s like Eye of Beholder or the Might & Magic series, but not their feel. I started playing the Quest with a gleeful joy and in long stretches of time, but as I discovered the game’s many glaring faults along the way, my impression dwindled to mostly positive status. It looks great, sounds great, the combat is okay, but the writing and the quests are quite bad.

The Quest starts with you being the new and untrained King’s Agent, while you discover the mysteries of the lonely archipelago and who are the enemies of the Kingdom. And the world looks beautiful: for a 2D game, the Quest looks life-like, with vibrant colors and sharp, detailed sprites that look great on a widescreen monitor. As you stroll through the sandbox design of these islands, you’ll stroll through the dark and foreboding forests, bustling medieval cities mired in stone and wood, fossilized woods that were terrorized by volcanoes, snow covered valleys and icy lakes, and the dangerous dungeons that taunt you with a promise of dazzling riches. The sound of fight and the chirping birds in the distance help solidify your belonging in this meticulously hand-crafted world, and the music, while simple, effectively enchants your travels in this world. When you enter the houses, castles and vendor’s places, you are greeted with nicely crafted portraits of NPCs eager to engage in a chit-chat about how they’re in trouble and need your help with some minor thing. From beggars to the King, everyone needs YOU to solve their problems, and you are at the center of everything that’s happening in the archipelago.

[h1]Proving Grounds[/h1]

Some of the quests you’ll pick up along can be solved in a couple of ways, but most are single-minded in how you complete them. You are always alone in this game; there are no characters that will join you, nor can you create a group of heroes that will fight together. On the other hand, while your travels can be lonesome, every skill you have can and will be used to show how much you’ve evolved. Some quests will require you to be sneaky, or be good with lock picks; maybe your ability to recognize authentic magic weapons from cheap imitations will be put to the test. If you’re not fighting, your persuasion skills will be most important tool to get bits of crucial information. Some quests cannot be completed if you’re not good at certain skill, which can also be a hindrance since you’ll have to plan on levelling up in advance the skills you previously thought to be unimportant. All skills have a governing attribute: strength, endurance, dexterity, intelligence and charisma, and they cannot be higher than these attributes times two. Changing how your character will develop as you gain levels on the go is essential to being completionist in this game. Adaptability is the key, and there are lots of books that will give you a small, permanent boost in various skills. Your reward in being versatile and victorious is the varied loot that can be enchanted with custom made magic. There is also the way you are dressed that will make NPCs more or less willing to be friendly: it’s more akin to flavor text, since your skills will govern in which direction the dialogue will go.

[h1]Eternal Struggle[/h1]

What you’ll do mostly in the Quest is fighting, whether with cold weapons and shields, knives in every hand, sturdy bows to pick enemies from the distance or powerful arcana arts with many offensive and defensive magics. Even though there is a lot of variety in how you’re dealing with enemies, most of the time, the combat is simplistic and lacks the oomph that will keep your attention glued to every new enemy encounter, which is the first glaring problem with the Quest, but definitely not its biggest flaw. Your opponents use slow animations to attack which unnecessarily slows down the combat, they also lack alternative attack modes to spice things up when you’re feeling overconfident; enemies that are using magic are underused, they always fling one or two types of magic, instead of varying the mix up to keep you on your toes, there’s no magic to control the battlefield that would greatly introduce the tactical element in combat. Combat traits would also greatly enhance the way you or your enemies fight, and they are sorely missing in this game. To the game’s credit, enemies do show basic intelligence by side stepping or temporary retreating when their health is low, which you can use to your advantage to better prepare or heal yourself. So while the combat is decent, you will start to loose focus in the long term, since you’ve done this hundreds of times now, and you’ll feel too powerful for the most part.

[h1]Scanty Words[/h1]

The biggest flaw of this game definitely is the writing and the way quests are designed. In the vanilla version of the game, the writing is inconsistent, with some dialogue or descriptions being okay while others are truly bad. Characters you meet act like lunatics, being helpful one minute then becoming over aggressive and illogical the next minute. They lack defining qualities, desires and goals, making them all forgettable and uninteresting. Things improve a bit in the DLC, but largely the writing feels amateurish: it’s rough and lacks polish and focus. Quests are similarly underwhelming: including vanilla game and the DLC, the Quest has between 80 and 90 quests available, both main and side quests included. Out of all these quests, I’ve enjoyed about 5 of them, another 5 I’ve loathed, and all the others were forgettable. For the most part in all quests, you’ll be doing the same thing and that is fetching something. Some characters in certain parts of the main questline will happily take control and the choice from you to steer the plot in predetermined way, which is the worst thing you can do to players: snatching the choices they make or giving them a false illusion of choice. While the main story in vanilla game is uninspired and chaotic, story in the DLC is somewhat better: things start slow and uninvolving but the second half of the story picks up the pace and becomes interesting; with decently written characters you meet as you investigate the murder a la “The Name of the Rose” style. I do hope that when developers decide to make a sequel, they hire a writer to elevate the overall poor writing.

[h1]Journey Continues[/h1]

Overall, I had fun for the most part, and do keep in mind this is a long game that will easily take you 30 hours or more to complete. When the Quest is good, it shines with overall quality work put on display, but when the Quest is bad, it can push you away from enjoying and immersion. There are certainly better options for grid-based old-school RPG, but for a two man team, The Quest is alright."
"买完II发现剧情都忘了...重新打了一遍, 这次注意到很多小细节做的不错, 滋磁."
"Clever game. Love the concept and the execution. Really awesome pixel graphics and just fun to play. It's short if you play it through just the one way but each character not only has a normal and hard mode, they each have their own unique spin on the level. As well you can play to beat your time forever if you want. Highly recommend, especially at this price. Looking forward to seeing more from this developer."
"With its hulking, calamitous warmachines, cold, stylish synth-laden soundtrack, and grim totalitarian setting, Brigador feels like an iron-handed ode to all the classic isometric sci-fi games of the nineties. To put it bluntly, it kicks a lot of ass. There is just something really special about eviscerating everything in your way (yes, as the trailer says, *everything*) in a 50 ft. metallic beast that spews molten death, while armed forces hopelessly throw everything they got at you to put an end to your orgy of annihilation. It is just fucking rad. 

As someone who grew up with Crusader, Syndicate, Command & Conquer, Mech Commander and a bunch of other PC games of their ilk, Brigador made me a little teary-eyed. It was like I was a kid again, gleefully playing on my crappy hand-me-down computer that could barely run Red Alert 2. I haven't played a game that made me feel like that in a long time."
"Even though i just discovered the game quite recently and played it and beaten it. It was a nice little indie game to play. Some could argue about it being pure luck based or whatever, but i don't think that's a bad thing. This game would make a good multiplayer game with friends, and not just like a local thing but more of an online one. Some other things i would suggest is like character customization and more maps to play. But other than that, this is a nice little indie game that's basically just a buck to play"
im color blind
a neat and rewarding puzzle game.  Chill
Another nice game from the Hercules series!
"Good gameplay inside, but no actual game. It would benefit greatly from proper progression and campaign; as it is, it is a time killer, and not very replayable."
"Rehtona is a great puzzle-platformer, with crisp gameplay mechanics, clever level design, and beautiful pixel art graphics.

However, if you're going to spend money on it, buy the mobile version. The desktop version is way outdated, has no extra content, and generally doesn't seem to be supported by the developers anymore. In comparison, the mobile game gets regular updates, and has way more content — tons of DLC levels, as well as a level editor — all of which can be acquired for about the same price as the desktop version. The only downside to the mobile version is that it's very demanding, so slower phones and tablets may have trouble running it.

Update: as of April 2021, the mobile version has also stopped receiving updates. But otherwise, everything above still holds true, so I still recommend getting that over the desktop version."
"[h1]200 character summary[/h1]
Wizard of Legend is a fast paced roguelite spell and slash with great pixel art. Easy to learn and hard to master. You can beat it in 25 minutes, It might take you a few hundred tries.

[h1]Story [b]8/10[/b][/h1]
The story is about becoming a Wizard of Legend, There is not much of a story you play trough, You have a small intro at the beginning of the game explaining the backstory, And the first time you beat the game you will unlock a few new options to further enhance the game. Games like these are not really about the story, But I love the little backstory they gave, how it is implemented in the tutorial and how it does not hinder the gameplay in any way. It is a nice game if you have an hour to spend, Just play, die and be done with it.

[h1]Gamemodes [b]9/10[/b][/h1]
You can play the whole game solo or in Offline sharescreen coop with a friend, not a single run wil be the same due to the procedural generated dungeons. There is also a Versus mode exclusively for 2 players. It has a Bosh Rush mode, But the focus is certainly the main game, Which is just amazing, And due to the unpredictability of the runs every run is completely different.

Coop is completely fair, Player 2 is not playing the dog, Player 2 will be able to perform all actions is not able to walk off the screen and he doesn't get teleported to player 1 if he wanders too far. Which is a pretty common problem in ""coop"" games, Wizard of Legend's coop mode is just perfect, And after every boss you get to fight eachother to spice things up a bit.

[h1]Gameplay [b]11/10[/b][/h1]
You start the game in your house, Here you have a book which contains all your unlocked spells, A closet which stores your unlocked outfits and a chest which stores your unlocked relics, If you exit the house you come to the market place, Here you can start a run in the dungeon, buy new outfits, Relics or Spells, tweak your next run, enter boss rush mode or do something with one of the other NPCs.

In the dungeon you get 3 different biomes, Earth, Fire, Water, Air, and Shock, These will be random unless you bribe a certain NPC, Each Biome has 2 levels and then the boss, after that you will battle the grandmaster. So you play 1.1 1.2 Boss, 2.1 2.2 Boss, 3.1 3.2 Boss, Final Boss, This will be the same every run, But the dungeons are never the same. Each biome does have a certain boss which will not be randomized. All normal levels also have a mini boss that you need to defeat before you can continue.

Every run you collect gems and coins, The coins you lose when you die, It is the currency in the dungeon, But the gems they remain, you do not lose any gems when you die. These gems is the currency outside of the dungeon, You unlock new items with these and you can start boss rush against a small payment for example.

Arcanas are the spells you can carry with you, there are about 200 now. Each Arcana is different, You can buy them at the market, You start the game with 4 arcana of your choice and you can find, loot and buy more in the dungeon, The ones you loot are instantly unlocked so you do not have to buy them any more outside of the dungeon.

Relics are items you find a lot in dungeons, you can buy them from several people and they all tweak the game in a certain way, There are about 180 of them now, Some offer great advantages, others not so great, But it allows you to tweak your character very nicely. There are also cursed relics, these are relics that you can not drop, they often have a downside too, So choose wisely.

Outfits also offer more than meets the eye, It is not just the color, every outfit has their own advantage, some increase health, or crit chance, or speed, etc. Combine the right outfit with the right spells and the right relics to build insanely powerful builds to crush the Grandmaster.

The gameplay is just right, The movement is great, it is simple to understand, but incredibly hard to master, You could go from full health to dead in seconds, The game is unpredictable, and having a great run depends a lot on luck. But a real Wizard of Legend can manage every situation. 

[h1]Aesthetics [b]10/10[/b][/h1]
It has amazing Pixel art, All the spells look great and have unique animations, the characters look great and have perfect motion, It is charming, but don't let the charms distract you, The game is very hard, Even the best runs can turn around in seconds if you don't keep your focus on the ongoing battle. The soundtrack is also pretty great, It fits the theme perfectly, Each item, everything has a great amount of detail. I think Wizard of Legend like many other games perfected the Pixel formula.

[h1]Performance [b]8/10[/b][/h1]
It runs just amazing, The only bad thing is that Cloud save is not working on Linux, I think this is especially important in roguelites like these. If you fail to backup your saves manually you will lose all your progress.

[h1]Replayability [b]10/10[/b][/h1]
The replayability is just perfect, ofcourse you can have millions of different builds which spice up the game quite a bit but it also has a lot of RNG for which Items you will be able to get, What monsters you encounter. The game will always remain a challenge. 

[h1]Improvements[/h1]
I really think it is a bummer it has no Online Co op. And it could use some more Dungeons. Ofcourse the Steam Cloud save not working on Linux should be fixed, But other than that the game is just perfect.

[h1]Conclusion [b]10/10[/b][/h1]
If you like character building and you like fast paced combat, Wizard of Legend is the game for you. I personally think this game is a Solid 9, I would recommend this to anyone, It is Easy to understand, and Hard to master, You can go for a short game, or you could lose your entire day in it. It is fun, fast and incredibly hard.

"If you're worried that this is a ""DIABLO"" clone , you're mistaken. It is a 100% Darksiders game with Hack N Slash Elements , Secrets ,  Weapons , Enchantments , Upgrades and Exploration just like in first two games , War plays very much like he did in the original game, and Strife is unique enough to be different from his brethren without losing his appeal as a Horseman (In other words he's like DEADPOOL). It is a perfect Darksiders game just with a different perspective. Go for it"
"I can't remember the last time i raged this hard at a game when Reimu stole my Lv3 Power Plant with a Suwako card, then I went 8 laps around the board without seeing a single one in the shop.

That aside, the game is a really fun game, its basically monopoly with added features + touhou. While its already quite fun on its own, imagine how much fun it would be to play with friends and then lose said friends when they steal your fully upgraded buildings.

10/10 would drive reimu to bankruptcy again, that'll teach you to take my power."
"Optimized well, and a brilliant game in the series. Completely reccomended if you have played on consoles and/or if you are a fan of the storm series."
"For 15,- NOK this is a gem. Your brain will twist and turn in vain through each level. 
If you ever reach level 100, please give me a call, I want to have babies with you..."
